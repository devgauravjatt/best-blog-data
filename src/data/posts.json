      "content": "<p>Since ChatGPT arrived on the net in 2022, AI-generated content has soared more than 8,000%, according to a study released Tuesday by <a href=\"https://copyleaks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copyleaks</a>. The study, which covers a period from 2013 to March 2024, found a surge of 8,362% in AI content on the internet from November 2022, when ChatGPT-3.5 was released, to March 2024.</p>\n<p>When OpenAI released ChatGPT-3 in June 2020, there was only a modest increase in web pages containing AI content. That changed with the release of version 3.5. Since then, 1.57% of some one million web pages analyzed for the study contain AI-generated content, noted Copyleaks, which offers AI-based text analysis and plagiarism services.</p>\n<p>“That 1.57% is massive, considering the amount of time AI technology has been available,” Chris Rodgers, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.coloradoseopros.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CSP</a>, a specialized SEO agency in Golden, Colo., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>The surge in AI content is primarily fueled by significant advancements in natural language processing and deep learning technologies, explained Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin.</p>\n<p>“These advancements have made it easier and faster to generate high-quality text, enabling AI models like ChatGPT to produce human-like content efficiently,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Additionally,” Yamin continued, “the demand for scalable and cost-effective content creation across various industries, such as e-commerce, marketing, and media, has further propelled the adoption of AI-generated content, driving its exponential growth on the web.”</p>\n<h3>AI Content Surge No Surprise to Industry Experts</h3>\n<p>Technology watchers aren’t surprised by Copyleaks’ findings.</p>\n<p>“AI is getting a ton of hype pushing more and more people to try these AI tools,” noted Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“The tools mostly work reasonably well and are relatively easy to learn and use,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They allow you to create decent content far more quickly, resulting in greater proliferation than pre-AI tools.”</p>\n<p>One group that immediately saw the value of AI content was one in a position to flood web pages with it. “This might not be a popular thing to say, but give marketers any chance to take a shortcut to success, and it will be used,” declared Joe Karasin, CMO and founder of Karasin PPC, a marketing agency in Lapeer, Mich., that specializes in Google ads.</p>\n<p>“This is why automated bidding in Google Ads is so popular,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Instead of having to do the math and the legwork to be competitive, it operates on a principle of ‘set it and forget it.'”</p>\n<p>Brian Prince, founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://topaitools.com\">Top AI Tools</a>, an AI tool, resource, and educational platform in Boca Raton, Fla., agreed. “When people and businesses can find a shortcut, making tasks faster and easier, they will use it,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Keeping that in mind,” he continued, “I’m not surprised that brands started using AI to create content as soon as generative AI reached the stage where it was possible.”</p>\n<h3>Google Gooses AI Content</h3>\n<p>Google may have opened the gates to AI marketing content by changing its stance. “Once Google said it didn’t care how content is generated, as long as it meets certain criteria, marketers took that as a green light to start churning out AI content,” CSP’s Rodgers said.</p>\n<p>“People saw that they could scale out content very, very quickly and that they could replace human writers and offset costs,” he continued. “So, I’m not surprised how much it’s exploded because of those things.”</p>\n<p>Prince, however, maintained that AI-generated content has a minor place in marketing materials and social media content. “It’s not about using AI to generate content,” he said. “AI can assist human writers by helping them organize their ideas and spark creativity. It can also help edit, resulting in cleaner, easier-to-read content.”</p>\n<p>“For tasks like social media, AI can help you take a single concept and slant it in endless ways,” he continued. “Then, human writers can modify and personalize it.”</p>\n<p>“AI also plays a unique role in video development,” he added, “democratizing the production of videos and graphics by simplifying it through programs like Synesthesia, Dall-E, and Canva.”</p>\n<h3>AI Benefits for Digital Platforms</h3>\n<p>Copyleaks’ Yamin also noted that AI-generated content could make a positive contribution to the internet and other digital platforms. “AI-generated content offers several potential benefits to the web,” he said. “It enhances user experiences by providing personalized recommendations, improving search engine results, and automating routine tasks like customer support and data analysis.</p>\n<p>“This efficiency saves time and resources and opens up new content creation and dissemination possibilities,” he continued. “Moreover, AI content can facilitate accessibility by automatically translating and adapting information to diverse audiences, thereby broadening the reach and impact of online content.”</p>\n<p>While AI content has its benefits, it also has harmful potential. “The rapid growth of AI-generated content, fueled by the increased accessibility of this technology, has led to AI-powered fraud becoming a top concern in the verification industry,” said Pavel Godman-Kalaydin, head of AI/ML at Sumsub, a global deepfake detection and identity verification company.</p>\n<p>“Deepfake technology continues to pose a significant threat,” he continued. “Advancements in AI have made it easier and cheaper for criminals to create incredibly realistic audio, photo, and video manipulations to deceive individuals,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“In North America alone, a 1740% increase in deepfakes was detected between 2022 and 2023 with a 10-times increase globally. Criminals now have access to easy-to-use AI systems that can easily generate a fake persona or impersonate an existing person, leading to media manipulation, misinformation, and disinformation,” Godman-Kalaydin added.</p>\n<h3>Fostering Trust and Accountability</h3>\n<p>As AI technology evolves, Yamin noted, solutions that provide visibility around AI use and sensible AI regulations are a continued need for the public to have a sense of trust and safety.</p>\n<p>“Clear labeling and disclosure standards should be implemented to improve transparency and accountability in AI-generated content,” he added. “Users should be aware of AI’s involvement in content creation through standardized indicators or disclaimers.”</p>\n<p>“Enhancing transparency in the use of AI-generated content is crucial for fostering trust and accountability,” agreed Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Promoting industry standards and best practices for transparency in AI content creation can encourage companies to adopt transparent practices voluntarily,” he told TechNewsWorld. “By implementing these measures, stakeholders can work towards building a more transparent and trustworthy environment for AI-generated content on the web.”</p>\n<p>Yamin added: “The swift integration of AI-generated content into web platforms reflects AI technologies’ transformative potential and the pressing need for effective governance and ethical guidelines. While the speed of adoption underscores AI’s efficiency and utility, managing its implications for accuracy, transparency, and user trust remains a critical challenge for stakeholders.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A new video venture announced by Elon Musk will face some strong challenges from entrenched incumbents, according to pundits interviewed by TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Reports began appearing last week that the bête noire of social media is crafting an app to stream long-form videos to users of X (formerly Twitter). “You can soon watch your favorite X long-form videos directly on your SmartTVs,” Musk revealed on X via the DogeDesigner account.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Coming soon <a href=\"https://t.co/JlnlSL7eS9\">https://t.co/JlnlSL7eS9</a></p>\n<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1766304130690056322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The upcoming service will be launched on Samsung TVs and Amazon’s Fire TV platform and will be a YouTube-like long-form video streaming service designed to make it easier and more comfortable to watch long-form content on a bigger screen, <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/x-twitter-video-streaming-app-launching-samsung-tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SamMobile</a> reported Monday.</p>\n<p>Musk has said X would be a “video-first” platform moving forward, and this development shows that this will translate beyond the small content boxes typically available on feeds to a bigger screen, according to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/x-will-launch-a-youtube-like-video-app-on-samsung-and-amazon-tvs-120004624.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Engadget</a>.</p>\n<p>Experts said Musk’s announcement is more than bluster. “The likelihood that he’ll try this is high. The likelihood, given how he has mismanaged Twitter, in him doing this right is exceedingly low,” observed Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“This is not an area he has shown a competency in,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Formidable Ambition Versus Formidable Competition</h3>\n<p>Musk’s track record of disrupting industries with ventures like Tesla and SpaceX demonstrates his capacity for bold innovation. Yet, the streaming market is fiercely competitive, with established players like YouTube dominating, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Success would depend on Musk’s ability to offer unique features, compelling content, and seamless integration with Samsung TVs while addressing user concerns about privacy and data security,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“While his vision and ambition are formidable, the journey to establishing a credible alternative to YouTube on Samsung smart TVs is fraught with obstacles, making success uncertain but not impossible,” he said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/school-of-communication/faculty/mike-horning.html \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Horning</a>, an associate professor of multimedia journalism at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Va., was unsurprised by Musk’s announcement. “I felt he was going to move in this direction when he hired Linda Yaccarino to be CEO of X,” he told TechNewsWorld. Yaccarino is a former executive from NBCUniversal with deep ties to the advertising industry.</p>\n<p>However, Matthew Dolgin, a senior equity analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago, was skeptical of Musk’s tweet. “Based on his history and the reported challenges at X, I would say it’s premature to expect that this will come to fruition,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Dolgin doesn’t see a demand for what Musk is offering from either consumers or content providers. “From a consumer perspective, we don’t see one. YouTube is free, easy to use, and widely accessible,” he said.</p>\n<p>“From the perspective of content providers,” he continued, “we think they benefit greatly from the network effects of Google and YouTube, so we wouldn’t expect them to be looking for an alternative platform, either.”</p>\n<p>“Any demand on that end would have to be driven by an expectation of materially greater income for the content providers,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Better Storytelling Platform?</h3>\n<p>Enderle agreed that there doesn’t appear to be any demand for what Musk is selling right now. “Demand would have to be built, and Musk doesn’t really believe in marketing, so he’ll try to use Twitter to create that demand,” he said. “I don’t expect it will end well, given how many folks have dropped Twitter.”</p>\n<p>Vena, though, does see a market opening for Musk. “As streaming becomes increasingly popular, users are seeking diverse content options beyond what YouTube offers,” he explained. “A competitive service could cater to niche interests, provide exclusive content, or offer a more curated viewing experience.”</p>\n<p>He added that concerns over data privacy and content moderation on YouTube have also spurred interest in alternatives that prioritize user control and safety.</p>\n<p>“Moreover,” he continued, “the proliferation of smart TVs has created a ripe market for new streaming platforms to integrate seamlessly into home entertainment systems.”</p>\n<p>“Overall, the demand for a YouTube competitor in the TV space reflects both a desire for innovation and a quest for alternatives that better align with users’ preferences and values,” he said.</p>\n<p>A Musk alternative might also offer content creators greater freedom, maintained Neil Chase, a writer, actor, story coach, filmmaker, and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.brimstonepictures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brimstone Pictures</a> in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>\n<p>“All content on streaming services is curated to such a degree that the quality of storytelling and informational content has gotten generally weaker,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are certain things people are allowed to say and certain things they are not. This is a fact.”</p>\n<p>“The one thing that Musk brings to the table that others don’t is a platform for storytellers and content creators to express their creativity and thoughts in a space that’s less regulated,” Chase asserted. “This is attractive to a certain percentage of both content creators and audiences.”</p>\n<h3>Eye Toward Universal App</h3>\n<p>Musk may also believe YouTube is spreading itself too thin to compete with market upstarts. “YouTube has been expanding, trying to take on TikTok and Reels,” explained Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Maybe Musk feels that is an opportunity, that YouTube is taking its eye off the ball chasing short-form video, and there’s an opportunity to appeal to content providers who want to do more substantial or cerebral types of content,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Rubin noted, however, that one of the significant challenges for Musk is that X seems to be losing, not gaining, momentum in terms of membership growth and advertiser growth.”</p>\n<p>That was evident in a report released earlier this month by Edison Research. The research noted that in 2022 and 2023, 27% of the total population in the U.S. reported using Twitter. In 2024, 19% of the total population in the U.S. is using X, a 30% drop.</p>\n<p>Musk’s move into TV appears to be part of his goal to make X a universal app, a place where users can go to satisfy all their online needs.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure his engineering team can do whatever he wants to do,” Rubin said. “The question isn’t functionality. It’s making X the go-to service for multiple functions the way WeChat is in China.”</p>\n<p>“That is a tall order,” he continued. “In the U.S., we have the kinds of incumbents that weren’t in China as WeChat rose to prominence.”</p>\n<p>“You can put all the components in place, but how are you going to attract people to the platform?” he asked. “How do you onramp people to this integrated service offering?”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>If electric vehicles are going to start crowding gasoline burners off America’s roads, not only will its charging infrastructure need a big boost, but so will the software at its charging stations.</p>\n<p>“Software has a very important role to play in improving the ownership and charging experience for EVs,” said Edward Sanchez, a senior analyst in the automotive practice of <a href=\"https://www.techinsights.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechInsights</a>, a global technology intelligence company.</p>\n<p>“Frustration with the inconsistency and reliability of public EV charging has been a major obstacle to adoption, and one of the major contributors to non-Tesla EV owners reporting that they are considering going back to an [internal combustion engine] vehicle,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The proportion of Tesla owners wanting to go back to ICE is much lower,” he continued, “due in large part to the superiority of Tesla’s DC fast charging experience with the Supercharger network.”</p>\n<h3>Follow Tesla’s Lead</h3>\n<p>Advanced charger software will address a bothersome problem for current EV owners, noted <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-orr-director-of-bids-and-proposals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emma Orr</a>, bid director at Winning Business, a provider of consultancy services in the U.K.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest issues currently is that not all charging stations are contactless,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Without it, people have to download different apps, and if you are in a location without a wireless connection, you might not be able to connect.”</p>\n<p>“We can also expect to see more subscription models and pay-per-use options,” she added.</p>\n<p>Sanchez noted that payment charging and initiation are among the top complaints about current charging stations. He predicted there will be a broader adoption of the ISO 15118 “plug and charge” standard. “Tesla was one of the first to market with its own proprietary version of plug and charge,” he added.</p>\n<p>Charger software makers ought to look to Tesla for direction, maintained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Tesla-Model-Y-charging.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla Model Y and Tesla Charger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Tesla-Model-Y-charging.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Tesla-Model-Y-charging-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Tesla-Model-Y-charging-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>“The Tesla stations talk to the car and handle the transactions far more seamlessly than the others,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The future software should work like that, where you just plug in and look to the car’s internal display for progress without the need for the transactional software on most non-Tesla chargers.”</p>\n<h3>Crucial Role in Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Advanced software at the charger will also be essential as the charging infrastructure scales. “Advanced software at charging stations plays a crucial role in addressing scalability issues as the EV charging system grows,” said Lew Cox, senior director of business development at <a href=\"https://www.xcharge.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">XCharge North America</a>, a global provider of EV charging solutions.</p>\n<p>“Advanced software ensures that EV charging stations can scale effectively to meet growing demand while maintaining reliability, efficiency, and user satisfaction,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the ways cited by Cox that advanced charger software can address scalability issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better Demand Management.</strong> Advanced software can monitor and manage the energy demand across multiple charging stations. By intelligently distributing power, advanced software prevents grid overloads and ensures efficient energy use, even during peak times.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Load Balancing.</strong> Advanced software can balance the load between multiple chargers, optimizing the charging process and reducing strain on individual chargers. As the number of EVs on the road increases, this helps maintain consistent EV charger performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Predictive Maintenance.</strong> By utilizing data analytics, advanced software can predict potential maintenance issues before they become critical. This proactive approach minimizes charger downtime and ensures that the charging infrastructure remains reliable as it scales.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Real-Time Monitoring and Control.</strong> Advanced software provides real-time insights into the performance and usage of charging stations. This allows operators to make informed decisions quickly, optimizing the overall performance of the EV charging system as it grows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Battery Integrated Technology</h3>\n<p>Cox also maintained that advanced charger software could be used to manage the integration of renewable energy sources into the EV charging infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Sanchez, though, asserted that the application and distribution of renewable energy into charging networks will be managed primarily at the cloud level.</p>\n<p>“There are also a lot of variables with that scenario, including the availability of renewable energy in the region and the trading of renewable energy credits,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“There is a possibility that users could be offered a ‘green’ charging option at the charging station at some point,” he acknowledged, “but this is far down the list of priorities, with improved charging station reliability and uptime being the most urgent priorities at the moment.”</p>\n<p>Another energy source that could be integrated at the charger level is battery power.</p>\n<p>“Battery-integrated technology, managed by advanced software, can store excess energy during low demand periods and release it during peak demand,” Cox explained. “This not only helps stabilize the grid but also ensures there is always sufficient power available for charging, enhancing the scalability of the EV charging system.</p>\n<h3>‘Load Shaving’</h3>\n<p>“Being able to manage your load across your chargers is going to be increasingly important,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://guidehouseinsights.com/\">Guidehouse Insights</a>, a market intelligence company in Detroit.</p>\n<p>“As we have more and more EVs that want to charge, there will be a need to make sure we’re not drawing too heavily on the grid,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>There is some concern now that electric vehicles will overtax the grid as their presence grows on the roads. “I think with AI predictability and analytics, the grid will know when and where power is going to be required,” argued Rue Phillips, CEO of <a href=\"https://skillfusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SkillFusion</a>, an electric vehicle supply equipment service company in Rochester, Mich.</p>\n<p>In addition, batteries can be used for “peak shaving,” he added. “There never has to be a mass burden on the grid because batteries, which can be charged during the evenings, can be used first,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They will triage the power being used by the power stations and not put a mass demand on the grid.”</p>\n<h3>Waning EV Demand</h3>\n<p>How soon the electrical grid will start to feel the burden of EVs remains to be seen, as reports of a waning interest in the technology have emerged in recent months.</p>\n<p>“The popularity of EVs has been waning due to several factors, including high initial costs that make them less accessible to a broad range of consumers,” said Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“Limited charging infrastructure remains a significant hurdle, causing range anxiety and inconvenience for potential buyers,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Concerns about battery lifespan, recycling, and the environmental impact of battery production have also contributed to hesitancy, as well as competition from improved fuel-efficient gasoline vehicles and hybrids, which continue to challenge the adoption rate of fully electric vehicles,” he added.</p>\n<p>Seth Goldstein, an analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago, predicted volatile growth for EVs. “Some years we’ll see more growth than others, but we’re still going to see growth,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It’s not going to be 100% a year for the next decade sort of thing, but it will continue to grow, and there’s still a lot of consumer interest in EVs.”</p>\n<p>“Once we have a wide range of affordable vehicles that cost the same as those in the internal combustion engine categories and more fast chargers built along highways, we will see solid EV adoption, with or without subsidies,” he said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Over the last several weeks, we’ve had <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/google-i-o-did-microsoft-just-become-the-new-netscape-179199.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google I/O</a>, which highlighted the rollout of Google’s Gemini AI engine for smartphones; <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/microsoft-hits-hard-with-ai-but-is-the-pc-the-right-platform-179207.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Build</a>, which focused on its Copilot+ rollout for PCs; and Apple’s WWDC24 video, which showcased the rollout of AI on both PCs and smartphones.</p>\n<p>Google’s launch was well executed, focused on attractive and interesting features, and was well received. Microsoft’s event was a bit of a mess; its most advanced capabilities didn’t work on any existing hardware, didn’t encompass most of the PC market, and ran up a ton of negative press on the Recall feature, which got buried under false concerns surrounding privacy.</p>\n<p>Apple rolled out its AI — standing for “Apple Intelligence” in a cute spin — across most of its product line, nicely bridging PCs, tablets, and smartphones in a more compelling and comprehensive manner than either Google or Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore these AI product rollouts this week. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week: an advanced videoconferencing app that just embraced Apple’s Vision Pro to create an even more compelling solution for remote workers.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s Superior Approach to Event Keynotes</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest problems every company has today is how to market to users. Back when I was growing up, you had TV, radio, and a variety of publications, many focused on tech, in which you could advertise to get the word out. Today, those more traditional mediums are far less effective because people use the web, subscribe to ad-free video services, and learn how to use ad blockers or ignore web-based advertising.</p>\n<p>One way that &nbsp;companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have to get the message to users is through keynotes at events like I/O, Build, and WWDC. But only Apple treats its keynote as a long-form product promotion vehicle. In contrast, Google and Microsoft tend to adhere to traditional formats, targeting primarily the local developer audience.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>However, developers get interested in successful offerings, and keynotes don’t need to get into the weeds on products because there are generally breakout sessions that attendees can go to if they’re interested in the technical details. Most users are not interested, and I would argue that most attendees at these events are not focused on these details since each has their own area of interest, and often that area isn’t tied to the technical demonstration on stage.</p>\n<p>Thus, Apple’s focus on making its WWDC keynote into a long-form ad and focusing on the users of its products rather than the developers in the audience is a good move. While Apple still lacks the incredible on-stage presence that Steve Jobs had, it comes closer than anyone else to driving excitement and controlling the message surrounding its announcements.</p>\n<h3>Challenges in Microsoft’s AI Rollout</h3>\n<p>One of the problems Microsoft faced with using ChatGPT as its AI source was that this AI platform has experienced quality problems. These issues negatively impacted Microsoft’s offerings, leading the WSJ to rank it last among five AI assistants they tested. However, the latest version of ChatGPT, the one Apple referenced, came in second. Apple effectively didn’t couple ChatGPT to its OS. Instead, Apple linked to it as a user-triggered option which should mean any related problems will reflect poorly on OpenAI, not Apple.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk reportedly threatened to ban Apple smartphones for using ChatGPT. Given Tesla’s performance, I think people might be more willing to give up their Tesla than their iPhone, so I doubt this will end well for Tesla. Musk’s concern is unfounded anyway, as Apple appears to have separated ChatGPT from its OS, not embedded it.</p>\n<p>Both Apple and Microsoft announced aggressive indexing apps. Microsoft even branded its app “Recall.” These apps do the same things, but Microsoft was criticized heavily — and largely falsely — for using this technology to spy on users, while Apple, which spent more effort explaining how the technology protected personal information, did not.</p>\n<p>I expect this was partially due to Microsoft Build going first and generating negative press early enough for Apple to change its messaging so it didn’t face the same fate.</p>\n<h3>AI Coverage Comparison: Apple vs. Google and Microsoft</h3>\n<p>Google’s AI will function with Android smartphones, effectively blanketing most Android devices. Microsoft’s Copilot+, the most advanced AI solution, only initially works on Snapdragon X Elite laptops that ship tomorrow, effectively covering no hardware already in the market. Apple’s AI launch covered all of Apple’s lines. Though it doesn’t work natively on the Apple Watch, you can use the Watch to interface with it on your iPhone.</p>\n<p>These are developer events, so while developers could use the Google solution, they’d need to use it on their smartphone, not their workstation. Microsoft developers who use workstation-class products don’t get access to Copilot+ even though their discrete GPUs have far more power than NPUs to run AI loads. The best guess is that Microsoft did this to preserve Azure revenues, but intentionally limiting product coverage is a mistake to protect secondary revenue streams.</p>\n<p>Apple developers, in contrast, can use their AI on their smartphones, PCs (desktop/laptop), and tablets, giving Apple’s developers better support and coverage than Google’s or Microsoft’s developers.</p>\n<h3>Event Performance: Apple Leads the Pack</h3>\n<p>Apple has a history of strong launch events, although Microsoft has had better events a few times during Windows 95 and Xbox launches. To my recollection, Google has never had an event that eclipsed an Apple event, and Apple has even eclipsed CES a couple of times.</p>\n<p>Apple’s production values have appeared to increase significantly since the launch of Apple TV, and it is at least likely that this service is having a significant positive impact on the quality of Apple’s launches and events.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Google has YouTube, which is bigger than Apple TV, but Google doesn’t seem to use the talent or learnings from that service to improve the quality of its events and keynotes. Microsoft also has its own studio, but it doesn’t have the same level of capability as Apple or Google, and they don’t seem to use it for events. As a result, the quality of Microsoft’s efforts is below that of Apple and Google.</p>\n<h3>Apple Sets the Standard</h3>\n<p>Google I/O came first, and it was a decent initial effort that captured the interest of its smartphone customers but mostly left out its PC customers on Chromebooks.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s convoluted Copilot+ launch didn’t seem to learn anything from Google’s earlier effort. It positioned Recall very poorly, so it had to delay the initial shipment of the final OS to OEMs.</p>\n<p>Apple did it the best, encompassing almost all of its PC and smartphone products, positioning the applications well, and doing the best job of putting AI where its developers live, on their own hardware.</p>\n<p>Apple tactically adjusted its messaging and responded to the Microsoft Recall blowback, maintaining high-quality presentations and reinforcing customer loyalty. This strategic approach made their keynote worth watching.</p>\n<p>It’s not that Google or Microsoft couldn’t do as well, but neither company prioritizes this aspect enough to achieve the same level of excellence as Apple</p>\n<p>At WWDC, Apple once again set the bar for how to announce important products, features, and services. The others could have done the same. Unfortunately, they chose not to.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Campfire With Support for Apple Vision Pro</h3>\n<p>I’m a fan of <a href=\"https://www.campfire3d.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Campfire</a>, a new VR-focused conferencing and collaboration platform.

      "content": "<p>Move over Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. There’s a new digital assistant in town, although you need to be a facilities manager to appreciate it.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, BrainBox AI, the maker of an AI-powered facilities management solution, announced a virtual building assistant called ARIA (Artificial Responsive Intelligent Assistant).</p>\n<p>Powered by AWS Bedrock, ARIA is designed to enhance building efficiency by assimilating seamlessly into the day-to-day processes related to building management, explained the company, which is located in Montreal.</p>\n<p>It noted that ARIA, created for commercial and retail spaces, is equipped with the predictive ability to circumvent operational problems while maintaining a watchful eye over a building’s blind spots.</p>\n<p>“We took an autonomous AI agent and plugged it into our existing technology stack, which already had predictive capabilities,” BrainBox AI Cofounder and Chief Technology Officer Jean-Simon Venne said.</p>\n<p>“So, it will not only tell you what’s been happening over the last year, and here’s what’s happening now, but here’s what’s going to be happening in the next few months,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Then it will make some recommendations on what you should do to face that immediate future.”</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of an ultimate advisor,” he added, “telling you what to do to deal with situations on the horizon.”</p>\n<h3>Morale Booster</h3>\n<p>According to BrainBox, the combination of its core AI for HVAC technology and ARIA can make a significant impact on building operations management, reducing HVAC energy costs by up to 25% and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40%.</p>\n<p>ARIA can also impact the morale of facility managers. “Building and facility managers have such a long list of to-do’s [that] they’re always frustrated,” Venne explained. “By the time their shift is over, they only have time to do 20% of their list. They feel they’re failing because there are too many things to do.”</p>\n<p>“With ARIA, you have an assistant that allows you to do a lot of the work quicker,” he said. “You have a chance to get a good chunk of that to-do list done, while before, it was just impossible.”</p>\n<p>BrainBox noted that ARIA is designed to give facility managers a 360-degree view of a building’s data, zeroing in specifically on its systems and components to make accurate and holistically informed recommendations for strategic decision-making.</p>\n<p>Ingrained in ARIA’s design is two-way interaction, the company continued. Not only are facility managers and building operators prompted to carry out specific tasks, but they’re also informed about future actions that can lead to the most efficient and effective management of their building.</p>\n<p>Clients can “call” on ARIA via text or voice and seamlessly take their interactions from desktop to mobile without skipping a beat, the company boasted.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it added, ARIA’s generative AI engine works 24/7 to help clients prioritize and optimize their buildings — a feature that transforms building management from reactive to proactive, increases its value and directly contributes to an organization’s sustainability efforts.</p>\n<p>The following video displays ARIA’s use cases, demonstrating its capacity to enhance efficiency, reduce energy costs, and improve operational workflows in commercial and retail spaces.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ARIA by BrainBox AI\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfLDKCBBO64\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Avoiding AI Hallucinations</h3>\n<p>A concern often raised about generative AI tools is that they can “hallucinate” or produce answers to queries that sound good but are inaccurate or even wacky. There are a few reasons for that behavior.</p>\n<p>For example, while large language models (LLMs) are good at mimicking language patterns, they don’t truly understand the meaning of the text they process. This limitation can lead to them generating text that is grammatically correct but factually incorrect or nonsensical.</p>\n<p>The way an LLM chooses which words to generate next can also influence hallucinations. Some techniques prioritize fluency over accuracy, which can lead to creative but unreal outputs.</p>\n<p>In addition, some LLMs are trained on massive amounts of data scraped from the internet. That data can contain factual errors, biases, and just plain weird stuff. The model can pick up on these patterns and generate outputs that reflect them, even if they aren’t accurate.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>BrainBox avoids the hallucination problem by restricting what and how ARIA uses data. “Gen AI is an empty bucket,” Venne explained. “You need to plug it into a data sandbox. Then it can create something interesting.”</p>\n<p>“We’re plugging it into our existing tech stack, which has HVAC and other kinds of information in it for a building,” he said. “We built ARIA on top of the stack where it has access to that ocean of information and can analyze data trends.”</p>\n<p>“The sandbox for AI is limited to our data set,” he continued. “You could ask it, ‘Why did Napoleon lose the battle of Waterloo?’ but the response would be something like ‘Can we talk about your building portfolio? I’m not a historian.'”</p>\n<h3>Built on Bedrock</h3>\n<p>Venne noted that data translation has been one of the most challenging problems BrainBox has faced in developing its AI-powered solution over the last six years.</p>\n<p>“When you plug yourself into these systems, you rarely get a perfect data set,” he said. “You can have sensors giving you false readings. You can have gaps — a thermostat not giving you any readings for an hour. So we had to be able to extract clean data and make corrections in the data when it’s faulty.”</p>\n<p>“Once you have a super-structured set of clean data, using tools like generative AI is much easier,” he continued. “We trained our AI only on data that we have full control over. We validate it, and we know it’s accurate.”</p>\n<p>A key building block of ARIA is AWS Bedrock. “Bedrock gives us the opportunity to stay super flexible without having to commit to a technology decision that we might get stuck in in six months,” Venne explained.</p>\n<p>“Amazon Bedrock makes it easier for applications to leverage high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and others, via a single API call — all in one secure, fully-managed service,” said AWS Vice President and Global Head of Startups Howard Wright.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“Amazon Bedrock empowers applications like ARIA to be the most sophisticated and intelligent building manager assistant it can be, leveraging insights from multiple models and selecting the ones that are most appropriate for a specific use case or task,” Wright told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He explained that Amazon Bedrock takes the complexity out of building and scaling generative AI applications with foundation models.</p>\n<p>“Startups can quickly experiment with and evaluate top foundation models for specific use cases — from Claude 3 to Llama 2,” he noted. “From there, they can privately customize them with the startup’s own data using techniques such as fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation [RAG] and build agents that execute tasks using the startup’s enterprise systems and data sources.”</p>\n<p>“With buildings being responsible for almost 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and 27% of those emissions coming from the energy used to heat, cool, and power them, and the global stock of buildings expected to double by 2050, the challenge of heightening building sustainability isn’t just necessary — it’s urgent,” Wright added.</p>\n<p>“BrainBox AI is solving precisely this, using AI-driven technology trained on Amazon Bedrock to rethink energy systems and mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://canine.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canine Companions</a>, a service dog company, will announce new technology this week that enables trained canines to perform tasks, such as tamping down anxiety and interrupting nightmares, after receiving wireless alerts.</p>\n<p>Called CanineAlert, the technology is designed to be integrated with a service dog’s training to mitigate trauma-related nightmares, like those of military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to information provided to TechNewsWorld by Canine Companions.</p>\n<p>Beyond just interrupting nightmares, the company noted, the technology speeds up the recovery process, with the service dog initiating tasks to reduce anxiety and hypervigilance while supporting the veteran post-nightmare.</p>\n<p>Since receiving their service dogs, veterans have reported improvements in staying asleep, falling back asleep, and overall sleep quality, showcasing the effectiveness of the device in enhancing their sleep patterns and quality of life, the company added.</p>\n<p>“Service dogs are specifically trained to assist an individual with a disability,” explained <a href=\"https://vetmed.arizona.edu/person/kerri-rodriguez-ms-phd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kerri Rodriguez</a>, an assistant professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Arizona.</p>\n<p>“Psychiatric service dogs can be trained to assist individuals with a mental health condition such as PTSD or autism,” she told TechNewsWorld. “In the case of PTSD specifically, psychiatric service dogs can be trained to interrupt or alert to an individual’s anxiety, provide calming deep pressure, retrieve medication, or wake up the individual from nightmares.”</p>\n<p>“In addition to these trained tasks, we also know that dogs are great at providing nonjudgemental support that can be helpful for those who have experienced trauma,” she added. “For someone with PTSD, a dog’s companionship and comforting presence can also be therapeutic in itself.”</p>\n<h3>New Independence for Veterans</h3>\n<p>“We teach our service dogs commands that can help a veteran go out in public and have a life of independence that they did not have prior to receiving a dog,” observed Lindsay Grayson, chief revenue officer at <a href=\"https://k9sforwarriors.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">K9s for Warriors</a>, in Ponte Vedra, Fla.</p>\n<p>Those commands include “my lap,” where the dog places its paws on the veteran’s legs to relieve anxiety or give the vet a sense of security, and the equivalent of “watch my 6,” where a canine will watch for someone approaching the vet from behind.</p>\n<p>Vets with PTSD can be super-vigilant and worried about someone sneaking up behind them, Grayson explained. “The commands give them the sense of security and safety that the dog is watching their back for them and will alert them if someone is approaching,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Grayson noted that the majority of service dogs enlisted by K9s for Warriors are rescue dogs. The dogs must meet certain height, weight, and temperament standards to perform what’s required of them. For example, there’s a “brace” command in which a vet places up to 30% of their weight on the dog to rise from a sitting or kneeling position. “For reasons like that, we go for larger dogs,” she said.</p>\n<p>She added that training a dog takes five to eight months, and the success rate with rescue dogs is about 50%. “That’s because we don’t know what a rescue dog has been through before it went to a shelter,” she noted. “Sometimes, they have their own anxieties.”</p>\n<h3>Quality of Life Improvements</h3>\n<p>According to Canine Companions’ patent for its technology, a service dog’s handler will wear a device to monitor one or more of their physiological parameters. The monitoring device may include watches, fitness-tracking devices, bands, necklaces, or patches incorporating a processor.</p>\n<p>The handler’s monitoring device pairs with a device capable of delivering both a first and a second haptic alert to a service dog trained to interrupt PTSD-related episodes.</p>\n<p>The patent explained that while the service animal is trained to monitor its handler for specific actions or behaviors indicative of a PTSD episode, there are times when the service animal may be distracted by the environment — loud noises or crowds, for example — or the handler may not have any outward appearance or characteristics of distress. A dog may also not be aware of a handler’s distress if it’s resting or asleep.</p>\n<p>The patent also noted that in addition to being in wireless communication with the dog’s alert device, the data stored in the memory of the handler’s device can be transmitted to a portal for long-term storage and analysis. Stored data can be shared with one or more third parties, such as a physician, counselor, or trainer, who can use it for monitoring, adjustments, and research.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>According to Canine Companions, its service dogs have significantly impacted the quality of life of its veteran clients. More than half of them use nightmare interruption and recovery tasks daily or a few times per week. Of those who use the tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>85% report an improvement in nightmares and night terrors.</li>\n<li>89% report feeling more comfortable sleeping in a new location.</li>\n<li>88% report feeling more comfortable sleeping in their own bed.</li>\n<li>70% report feeling more comfortable sleeping without a protective tool.</li>\n<li>76% report improvement in falling asleep, staying asleep, and having fewer nightmares since receiving their service dog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Service Dogs Offer Healing and Hope to Veterans</h3>\n<p>Rodriguez noted that research suggests service dogs can be beneficial for military veterans with PTSD in several areas.</p>\n<p>“Our research has found that compared to veterans on the waitlist to receive a service dog, veterans placed with a service dog have significantly lower PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Having a service dog is also associated with less social isolation, greater resilience to stress, and better life satisfaction,” she added. “While service dogs are not a cure for PTSD, they have been shown to be associated with overall better well-being compared to usual care alone.”</p>\n<p>Grayson pointed out that service dogs can also have medical benefits for vets. “When a veteran enters our program, they can be on anywhere from 14 to 20 medications. Medications for anxiety and not being able to sleep, and that nature,” she explained. “When they get a dog, it relieves the need for those medications.”</p>\n<p>“There have been studies where service dogs have contributed to bringing their handler’s cortisol levels to a normal state,” she added. Chronically high cortisol levels are linked to a number of mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD.</p>\n<p>A service dog can also impact a vet’s mental health. “Studies show that a dog can give a veteran purpose,” Grayson said. When a warrior has suicidal thoughts, they’ll say, ‘I can’t leave my dog. Who will take care of my dog?’ There might be days they don’t want to get out of bed, but they’ll get up to feed and walk the dog.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen over time that a dog can give a veteran a life of dignity and independence that they had prior to their service,” she said. “They’re not relying on medications, and they’re happy.”</p>\n",

Still, there’s no reason you can’t switch to 24.04 today.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn the steps you need to take to upgrade from Ubuntu 23.10 to Ubuntu 24.04.</p>\n<h3>Why Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat?</h3>\n<p>One of the main advantages of switching to Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat is that as an LTS release, users will receive five years of free security maintenance on the main Ubuntu repository.</p>\n<p>Users who enroll in Ubuntu Pro, which is free for personal use, benefit from an extra five years of updates for both the main and universe repositories.</p>\n<p>Subscribers can also purchase the legacy support add-on for two years of additional support.</p>\n<p>If up to 12 years of support isn’t enough, Noble Numbat includes new <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-24-04-lts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">security features</a>, including user namespace restrictions, binary hardening, and disabling older versions of TLS and AppArmor 4.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, all of the Ubuntu 24.04 binary packages have been rebuilt in light of the hidden backdoor in the data compression package xz Utils, discovered in early April.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noble Numbat release notes</a> to discover all the advantages of upgrading.</p>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<p>Although you can technically update to Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat using Terminal <a href=\"#terminal\">(see below)</a>, Ubuntu supports easy upgrades to the next version using the integrated Software Updater.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, you first need to use the software updater to ensure your installation of Ubuntu 23.10 is up to date. Then, you can rerun the software updater to upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Ubuntu 23.10 will then launch the upgrade process, connecting to the necessary software channels and applicable packages. You’ll also be offered the choice to remove any obsolete packages.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu disables third-party repositories and PPAs by default. Once the OS upgrades to version 24.04, you can re-enable these via the command line.</p>\n<h4>Step 1. Prepare Your System</h4>\n<p>The upgrade process to Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat is straightforward. However, it’s always a good idea to follow some basic precautions when making significant changes to your OS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save and close any open files and any running programs.</li>\n<li>If you’re using a portable device, make sure it’s plugged into a power source to prevent the battery from draining during the upgrade.</li>\n<li>Make sure to run a full system backup using your <a href=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/story/two-apps-that-make-backup-less-chore-more-lifesaver-70400.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">favorite utility</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, check that your current version of Ubuntu 23.10 is up to date. The simplest way to do this is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click the workspace switcher at the top left, then type “update” in the search box.</li>\n<li>Click the “Software Updater” icon to launch the utility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The software updater will now search for and display any available updates. Click “Install Now,” then enter your admin password to download and apply these.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Ubuntu-Software-Updater.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu Software Updater screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p>If Ubuntu 23.10 requires you to restart to apply any updates, click “Restart Now.”</p>\n<p>You can also use the command line to update Ubuntu 23.10. Open Terminal and run:</p>\n<p>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade</p>\n<p>Hit “Y” to update Ubuntu 23.10 to the most recent version.</p>\n<h4>Step 2. Get Ready To Upgrade</h4>\n<p>During the update process, the system will likely require you to reboot. If so, log in again to the Ubuntu Desktop.</p>\n<p>You can now repeat the steps above to launch the Software Updater via the workspace switcher (top left).</p>\n<p>You’ll next see a notification stating that Ubuntu 23.10 is up to date but that a new version (24.04) is available. Select “Upgrade” to continue.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Ubuntu-Software-up-to-date.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu Software check for update screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"460\"></p>\n<p>We didn’t see this option during our tests at first, as we were trying to upgrade only a few hours after Ubuntu 24.04 became available. If you have the same issue after launching Software Updater, close the utility, then launch Terminal.</p>\n<p>From here, run:</p>\n<p>sudo update-manager -c</p>\n<p>If you receive a notification stating that no new Ubuntu version has been found, add the ‘-d’ flag to the command:</p>\n<p>sudo update-manager -c -d</p>\n<p>The upgrade tool should now launch.</p>\n<h4>Step 3. Start the Upgrade</h4>\n<p>Once the upgrade wizard launches, it will display a brief introduction to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat and a link to the release notes. Take the time to visit the link and read through these to discover all the latest improvements in Noble Numbat.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Noble-Numbat-Welcome-screen.jpg\" alt=\"Noble Numbat Welcome screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\"></p>\n<p>Next, choose “Upgrade” to start downloading the release upgrade tool. Once this is complete, the tool will launch and state it’s “Preparing to Upgrade.” A window will now appear asking, “Do you want to Start the Upgrade?”</p>\n<p>Read through the information here, as it lists the number of packages to be installed and the space required. Then click “Start Upgrade” to continue.</p>\n<h4>Step 4. Install Your Upgrades</h4>\n<p>The release upgrade tool will begin by setting up new software channels and then start downloading the new packages mentioned in the previous step.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Noble-Numbat-installation.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat installation downloading new packages\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p>During this process, you may see a prompt regarding “libc6” asking whether Ubuntu should restart services during package upgrades without asking. Click “Next” to confirm.</p>\n<p>As the release upgrade tool begins installing the upgrades, you may notice that the system wallpaper will change to the default background for Noble Numbat. At this stage, you can also click “Terminal” to view detailed information on the upgrade process.</p>\n<h3>Step 5. Cleaning Up</h3>\n<p>When the release upgrade tool reaches the cleaning-up stage, a window will appear, encouraging you to “Remove obsolete packages.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Noble-Numbat-cleaning-up.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat: Remove obsolete packages\" width=\"1049\" height=\"267\"></p>\n<p>If unsure what to do, select “Details” to view a list of redundant packages. You can choose to “Keep” these, but in the interest of saving space, we recommend you choose “Remove.”</p>\n<h3>Step 6. Confirm Your Upgrade</h3>\n<p>Whether or not you choose to remove obsolete packages, Ubuntu will now ask you to restart the OS to complete the upgrade. Select “Restart Now” to continue.</p>\n<p>Once logged in to the Ubuntu 24.04 desktop, you can double-check that the upgrade was successful via System Settings. Simply click the workspace switcher at the top left and enter “about” in the search bar.</p>\n<p>From here, select “About” in Settings to view your OS version.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Ubuntu-Noble-Numbat-About.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat About screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\"></p>\n<p>You can also check the current version of Ubuntu via the Terminal command:</p>\n<p>lsb_release -a</p>\n<h4>Step 7. Re-enable PPAs and Repos</h4>\n<p>When Ubuntu is upgraded to a new version, by default, any third-party repositories and PPAs are disabled. Fortunately, these are easy to enable again via Terminal.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat has eliminated the traditional /etc/apt/sources.list in favor of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources for managing source configuration. This is to keep the OS in line with the new “deb822” format.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Ubuntu-Noble-Numbat-re-enable-ppa-repos.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Re-enable PPAs and Repos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"590\"></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the basic process for enabling repos/PPAS remains the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch Terminal and run:<br>\n<span>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources</span></li>\n<li>If any third-party repos or PPAs you use aren’t enabled, remove the ‘#’ at the start of the relevant line.</li>\n<li>Type Ctrl + X, then Y to exit and save changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stay Up-to-Date</h3>\n<p><a name=\"terminal\"></a></p>\n<p>Even after you’ve upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04, you should always check if any further updates have been released. To do this, repeat the instructions in Step 1 to run the Software Updater.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, launch Terminal and then run:</p>\n<p>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</p>\n<p>Using the Terminal is advantageous in this case, as it will alert you if any of your third-party repositories/PPAs are still disabled.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 via the Command Line</h3>\n<p>If you’re an experienced Linux user, you may prefer to upgrade via the command line. This approach has some advantages in that there are no windows and buttons to manage, but first, make sure to go through Step 1 (above) to prepare your system and run a full backup.</p>\n<p>Next, open Terminal and run:</p>\n<p>sudo do-release-upgrade</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Noble-Numbat-terminal-upgrade.jpg\" alt=\"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS terminal upgrade message\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\"></p>\n<p>This command will specifically check for a new version of Ubuntu and prompt you if you wish to continue the upgrade. Tap ‘y’ to proceed.</p>\n<p>When we ran this command in Terminal for this tutorial, we saw a prompt stating that no new release of Ubuntu was available. We were able to fix this by adding the ‘-d’ flag, i.e.</p>\n<p>sudo do-release-upgrade -d</p>\n<p>We hope you find this step-by-step guide helpful for upgrading from Ubuntu 23.10 to 24.04, allowing your system to benefit from up to 12 years of security updates, performance improvements, and the latest features.</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The Ubuntu images and screenshots featured in this article are credited to Canonical.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I’ve seen a lot of warnings lately saying don’t load the Temu app or buy from the store. There have been plenty of accusations but few actual, validated facts.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been very leery of Facebook ads because I’ve lost around $150 on Facebook scams so far, I did recently buy a smart toilet from Homary to replace my $5,000 (now more like $7,000) Toto Neorest, which had started to sound like it was going to swallow me. Thankfully, the new one is working fine.</p>\n<p>Let me share my experiences with both companies as they compare to their far more expensive U.S. and Japanese competitors. We’ll end with my Product of the Week, the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, which is currently between six and 12 months ahead of AMD and Intel and sets the near-term bar for the AI PC.</p>\n<h3>Temu vs. Amazon</h3>\n<p>To say I buy a lot from Amazon would be an understatement. I rarely shop anywhere else, even though I almost stopped shopping there after a $200 Amazon gift card was stolen in transit, used, and not refunded. I’m still upset about that and have stopped buying Amazon gift cards, which, up until then, were my go-to gift purchase.</p>\n<p>Amazon’s advantages are that it delivers more quickly, the goods are better packaged, and the quality and customer support, except for that gift card issue, has been exceptional.</p>\n<p>Temu is a ton cheaper. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I bought a nice automatic dragon buckle belt from Amazon for $23.99. I purchased a similar automatic belt from Temu with a Jaguar (car) buckle for $9.19.</li>\n<li>I bought a nice back brace from Amazon that set me back $29.97. I bought a better one on Temu for $10.88.</li>\n<li>Most interestingly, on March 3, I bought an LED exhaust tip from Amazon for $41.39 out of China, which has yet to arrive, and the same exact thing from Temu on March 23 for $22.07, delivered on April 2.</li>\n<li>A keychain from Amazon was $11.99, and the same thing from Temu was $1.74, though it was delivered a week and a half later than the one from Amazon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, some things from Temu have been low quality, but I’ve had quality issues with eBay out of China from time to time, as well as stuff from Amazon. You have to be careful, but the Temu merchandise is 50 to 90% cheaper than similar things from Amazon.</p>\n<p>Some questionable items included a $15 smartwatch that worked but was hardly an Apple Watch replacement. I bought a pair of $17 tennis shoes that looked great but felt cheap, making me doubt whether they’d hold up. I’ve purchased several tools from Temu, and all have worked fine and were of similar quality to Craftsman, though not the same level of quality as Snap-on tools. Still, for me, they were fine, and for a little bit of money, I’ve really fleshed out my tool sets.</p>\n<h4>Temu Value, Privacy, Packaging</h4>\n<p>In general, I’ve been happy with the Temu experience once I got over the shipping time. They tend to text me a lot, but I’m not finding that particularly annoying, and I’ve bought from the offers a couple of times.</p>\n<p>As far as data capture is concerned, I got the app through the Google Store, which means it is curated, and I’m not yet seeing my online ads shift to whatever I shopped for, as I often do with Amazon. All online retailers capture data and use it to promote product sales. While I’ve seen the warnings that Temu is spying on you, I see less impact from Temu than from Amazon, Facebook, or even eBay. So, although the concern is real, the size of the problem doesn’t yet appear to be problematic.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>It can be addictive as you can shop for what seems like a lot of things and still not spend much over $100. The same experience on Amazon, or Costco for that matter, would typically have you spending hundreds more. All of these things can be a bit addictive, but at least Temu is far less expensive on average.</p>\n<p>One significant difference is packaging quality. Amazon’s is good, though wasteful in terms of cardboard use. Temu shoves everything into a plastic bag, which is more sustainable, though I’ve had two shipments arrive with the bag torn open. While nothing was lost, it supports the idea of not buying anything expensive on Temu yet.</p>\n<h3>Homary vs. Toto</h3>\n<p>For some time, the Toto Neorest smart toilet has been the gold standard for this class of bathroom products, but it is <a href=\"https://www.totousa.com/neorest-as-dual-flush-toilet-10-08-gpf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expensive</a>. If there is no repair facility close to you and you have a problem, you have to disassemble the toilet, send its “brain” back to Toto, and then wait for it to be repaired before you can use it again.</p>\n<p>When we remodeled our home, we bought three Toto toilets, two for $3,500 and one for $5,000. Of course, it was the $5,000 one that started to make sounds like it had eaten a bridge troll, and that troll was going to eat our backsides. Otherwise, the toilet has been problem-free and incredibly quiet.</p>\n<p>We needed a black toilet, and you can’t get one of those as a Neorest from Toto, at least not in my area. In addition, the noise caused by the toilet has increased in price to closer to $7,000. Given the repair issues, we considered getting a <a href=\"https://www.kohler.com/en/products/toilets/shop-toilets/numi-2-0-one-piece-elongated-smart-toilet-dual-flush-30754-pa?skuId=30754-PA-HB1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kohler Numi</a>, which does come in black but costs a whopping $10,000 (and looks really uncomfortable), or a <a href=\"https://www.homary.com/lditem/onepiece-elongated-smart-toilet-floor-mounted-automatic-toilet-selfclean-37775.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">black toilet from Homary</a>, which costs under $1,000.</p>\n<h4>Switching to Homary: A Smart Toilet Transition</h4>\n<p>Getting the Toto out and installing the Homary cost around $750, but it was pretty straightforward. The biggest issue is that both toilets are porcelain, making them pretty heavy to work with</p>\n<p>When we installed a black Homary, it looked better and functioned the same as the Toto. Yes, it makes more noise than the Toto did when it was new, and its remote looks more like something that would be connected to a TV rather than a toilet, but overall, we don’t seem to be missing the Toto, and the Homary (which is made in China) has worked flawlessly. Granted, it isn’t as high-quality as the Toto, but for a $6,000 savings, I’m willing to take a slight reduction in quality.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> I should add that it looks like Amazon has a similar smart toilet for a little more with a better remote. So, if you are in the market, you might also want to consider that one. (I didn’t think to check Amazon before buying from Homary.)</p>\n<p>I’ve also purchased a <a href=\"https://www.homary.com/item/humply-modern-black-leather-smart-nightstand-with-wireless-charger-drawers-bedside-table-47064.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nightstand</a> from Homary, which was reasonably priced and of decent quality. So far, Homary is a nice alternative to Amazon, and their toilet is a far cheaper alternative to the Toto Neorest or Kohler Numi.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>While you need to be careful when buying from any new vendor, I’ve found Temu and Homary to provide adequate quality products at reasonable, or in Temu’s case, really low prices. However, Temu shopping can be a bit addictive. While writing this column, I found a few things I wanted to get on the site. Now I’m down another $133, so do be careful.</p>\n<p>I think the Temu concerns are overblown. It feels to me like “someone” is trying to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) the vendor, a practice I’m not a fan of as it stinks of unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p>But do be careful, and best of luck with your shopping experiences. Now, excuse me, I think I see something else on Temu I want to buy. Oh crap.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Snapdragon X Elite</h3>\n<p>Microsoft has been pushing the AI PC hard, and the poster child processor for this new concept of an even smarter PC is the <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/pcs-and-tablets/snapdragon-x-elite \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite</a> solution. It’s the poster child because, when running AI, it doesn’t lose a ton of battery life.</p>\n<p>The coming wave of desktop AI (currently, AI mostly runs in the cloud) has to run all the time to be effective. But if the platform is too power-intensive, your battery life craters, which is why Microsoft went to Qualcomm, a leader in high-end smartphone technology, for a fix.</p>\n<p>This laptop solution is expected to be available in the next few months. Based on the third-party testing I’ve seen, it is six to 12 months ahead of its PC competitors. Be aware, though, that this desktop AI component isn’t fully cooked yet and may not be until closer to the end of the year. However, for AI use, at least initially, the Qualcomm part is able to take on all competitors.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/Snapdragon-X-Elite.jpg\" alt=\"Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/Snapdragon-X-Elite.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/Snapdragon-X-Elite-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/Snapdragon-X-Elite-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The Snapdragon X Elite processor is built for AI.

While the performance leaves a bit to be desired, the battery life is nothing short of amazing. I can leave my charger and laptop bag in the hotel room or at home and just carry the laptop. The new part not only adds AI capabilities but also increases the performance of the related laptop significantly while still maintaining that exceedingly high battery life.</p>\n<p>I mostly work in Office and will thus become a heavy user of Copilot.

      "content": "<p>As is typically the case when one company jumps ahead of the others, analysts like me get asked what makes Nvidia so much more successful than its peers. While my peers may have different answers, I think there is one predominant cause for this success: Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang.</p>\n<p>Huang has had three clear advantages that most other CEOs lack. First, Huang’s technical proficiency allows him to set and execute a vision. Second, Huang is a founder, which typically grants unusual loyalty and power over the company. Finally, he is the longest-serving tech CEO in recent history.</p>\n<p>I say “recent history” because Nvidia is around 30 years old, and IBM’s first CEO and founder, Thomas Watson, served for 42 years during a time when IBM pretty much <em>was</em> the tech industry and was even more successful than Nvidia is now.</p>\n<p>Thomas Watson had the same three advantages as Huang. When Watson’s son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took over, he inherited those same advantages and took IBM to even greater levels by being additive. Huang has a son, Spencer, who works at Nvidia, but his true heir is AI, suggesting it could be either his or Spencer’s successor. Let’s talk about that this week.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, my new favorite smartphone, the Google Pixel Fold.</p>\n<h3>Why the CEO Job Is Broken: The Overcompensation Problem</h3>\n<p>CEOs are overcompensated, and this creates significant financial and operational problems in both public and private companies. CEOs weren’t always the highest-paid positions.</p>\n<p>When I first entered the tech field, one of my jobs was managing compensation, and some of our sales reps made significantly more than the founding CEO. Granted, founders had founder stock, which eventually raised the CEO’s compensation when that stock was sold. But unlike today, CEO compensation wasn’t massively higher than that of other executives. Today’s CEOs are overcompensated, and that leads to three big problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The disparity creates friction among employees who feel they are doing the work while the CEO gets all the rewards. This situation is particularly problematic when a CEO institutes a layoff or salary reduction plan, and the employees feel they are being treated unfairly, given the CEO, even with salary cuts, is making crazy money. This reduces loyalty to the CEO, making the company less efficient and key employees less likely to remain with the company.</li>\n<li>The CEO is motivated to acquire things that, in turn, need to be managed, detracting from doing the job they are paid to do. Some CEOs have multiple mansions, yachts, and rare car collections that are all enviable, but these things have to be managed and take away time from the CEO’s ability to do the job they were hired for. This additionally exacerbates the feeling in the rank and file that the CEO is taking advantage of them, particularly when cutbacks occur.</li>\n<li>This overcompensation can convey a feeling that the CEO can do whatever they want. They are so used to having crazy money and extreme authority that they get the idea that rules don’t apply to them and discover the hard way that some rules do. CEOs getting fired for misogyny, mishandling of company assets, and other types of misbehavior are common and very disruptive to the company.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Advantage Enjoyed by Founders</h3>\n<p>Successful founders tend to prioritize the company and often aren’t known for excessive spending. This doesn’t mean they don’t sometimes spend excessively (Bill Gates did build a hotel of a house and then regretted it), but their possessions don’t significantly degrade their focus on their company and people.</p>\n<p>So, while I do think excessive compensation degrades their performance, it doesn’t seem to do so in a material way because their job and hobby are both the company and their true passion, and thus, they are able to outperform their more compensation-based peers.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Founders also know the company more intimately because they directed its construction. They know better than anyone what the company is capable of and can better set an achievable vision for the firm’s future. Hired CEOs may never truly understand what a firm is capable of and avoid “the vision thing” altogether because they don’t want to be seen as failures.</p>\n<h3>The Succession Problem With Founders</h3>\n<p>When a founder leaves, a company seems to lose its way. I was one of the folks who studied IBM’s decline and near collapse, and it was clear that when Thomas Watson Jr. left, IBM started to die. Interestingly, it didn’t start to die when Thomas Watson Sr. left because Jr. effectively took his father’s advantages and enhanced them, as he’d been groomed to do that.</p>\n<p>Still, even though I’d argue IBM has the best internal CEO training program and deepest bench of potential CEOs than any other company, it had to go outside that structure once, reset, and then rebuild because this “founder” capability was lost in transition.</p>\n<p>Corporations are supposed to be eternal, though Founder CEOs don’t always want them to be because they don’t want to be overshadowed by their successor. Watson Sr. was one of the exceptions since he, as most fathers should, seemed to want his son to be even more successful than he was.</p>\n<p>Succession just doesn’t seem to be a priority in most firms. Most CEOs seem more worried that their successor will be selected prematurely — and for good reason, because that often happens, which conflicts with a good succession process.</p>\n<h3>Digital Human Advantages</h3>\n<p>Nvidia has created the concept of “digital humans.” Today, they are built mainly for sales and customer support, but they could evolve into replacements for almost any job. For instance, Cognition Lab just launched the first AI software engineer called <a href=\"https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devin</a>, which can autonomously write apps. It can complete real-time jobs posted on Upwork and has autonomously resolved 14% of the GitHub issues found in real-world open-source projects.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of the emergence of digital humans.</p>\n<p>When it comes to succession, digital humans have several clear advantages over non-digital humans. One is that the digital human would be created to fully emulate the founder, so it wouldn’t reflect badly on them. Even when it out-achieved the founder it replaced, its hard connection to the founder would ensure the founder got the credit, so the prior CEO is less likely to sabotage the effort.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>A digital human doesn’t have a compensation problem as it wouldn’t need compensation, and it wouldn’t be distracted by personal possessions or family as it wouldn’t have those either. It also wouldn’t have the drives that often cause CEOs to misbehave, though you’d want to ensure the information stream the digital human was receiving was uncompromised, and you’d need to ensure that the digital human was surrounded by sufficient security so it couldn’t be hacked.</p>\n<p>In other words, given how quickly a digital human could act, assuring they continue to perform in the best interests of the firm, its employees, and investors would be even more critical to ensure a human CEO didn’t go off the rails.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Why Nvidia Will Have the First Digital Human CEO</h3>\n<p>The reason I think Nvidia will be first is that it has the greatest need to preserve the advantages it gets from its founder, Jensen Huang. In addition, Huang is an AI advocate, which means that Nvidia not only leads in AI solutions but also uses AI internally. So, Huang has been a significant driver in both the creation and use of digital humans.</p>\n<p>Nvidia has the greatest need, the strongest foundation to create one, and by creating one it would have the best showcase for how a digital human could outperform a human at certain jobs. If a digital human could do the CEO’s job successfully, the question flips from “what could it do” to “what couldn’t it do,” with the latter list becoming ever shorter. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>Jensen Huang has at least a decade of service ahead of him, so I doubt this will happen quickly. Still, I could see him spinning up and training his digital twin long before he left the company to increase his reach, and he might not just create only one. I can imagine a future where “digital Jensen Huangs” are sold to firms as advanced CEO digital assistants and eventually as CEOs even before the real Jensen Huang steps down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The Google Pixel Fold</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Google-Pixel-Fold.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel Fold\" width=\"1000\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Google-Pixel-Fold.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Google-Pixel-Fold-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Google-Pixel-Fold-768x407.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>(Image Credit: Google/YouTube)</p>\n<p>My favorite smartphone was the Microsoft Duo 2, but with Panos Panay’s departure from Microsoft, I doubt Duo and Surface are long for this world.</p>\n<p>There is a rumor that a foldable Duo 3 is coming, but my Duo 2’s battery has degraded to the point that it won’t even stay up for 5 hours, let alone an entire day. I read books on my phone, so that’s a problem. So, I bit the bullet and went looking for a replacement. The dual-screen <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_fold_specs?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Pixel Fold</a> comes the closest to both what the Duo 2 was and the Duo 3 might be (if it ever launches; I have my doubts).</p>\n<p>I’ve been using this phone for about a week now, and so far, it is as good a reader as the Duo 2 and has far better battery life, even though it has both a foldable screen in the middle and an additional screen on the cover.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Google Pixel Fold: The Only Foldable Engineered by Google\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wobcM-WPQk\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One downside, however, is that Pixel Fold uses the Google Tensor G2 processor and not the Qualcomm Snapdragon solution, so it lacks several features. The one I miss the most is the ability to use a head-mounted display for movies. For me, the best advantage with Snapdragon is that everything just seems to work, and alternatives simply don’t provide that same level of capability.</p>\n<p>The phone isn’t a cheap date at $1,799. If I could have waited, I would have waited for the coming Pixel Fold 2, which is due out in a few months. But I couldn’t wait that long because my Duo had degraded to the point that it wasn’t usable, and I needed my phone to work.</p>\n<p>Since the Pixel Fold helped me solve my dying Microsoft Duo 2 phone problems, the Google Pixel Fold is my Product of the Week — and I really do enjoy using it.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Last week, I attended the HP Amplify Partner Conference along with the CEOs of AMD, Google, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. Each of these CEOs praised HP’s effort, but Jensen Huang stood out because he actively pitched HP’s new workstation and PC lines, which he had encouraged HP to build.</p>\n<p>One of the common discussions was why Dell was getting so much credit, given that it doesn’t have an AI solution and significantly lagged HP in security, partners, sustainability, and AI.</p>\n<p>At the end of the event, one of my favorite actors, Ryan Reynolds, joined virtually. Reynolds was on a shoot, but his partner was on stage and brought up the “Green Lantern” movie, which it’s been <a href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/ryan-reynolds-role-he-regrets-taking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> Reynolds regrets doing. I paid attention because I loved “Green Lantern” even though it underperformed.</p>\n<p>I realized that HP’s problem with Dell was what often happens when the marketing for a product and the product itself becomes decoupled, or the wrong people are convinced that an offering is for them.</p>\n<p>In the past, I’ve elegantly argued that this is a mismatch of form and function. Based on what was presented at Amplify, I’d like to name this problem the “Reynolds Green Lantern Conundrum.” Since this is a widespread problem, I will flesh it out this week.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new gaming laptop from HP that is the most sustainable, advanced, and attractive gaming notebook coming to market: the HP Omen Transcend 14-inch notebook.</p>\n<h3>IBM, Dell, and Form Over Function</h3>\n<p>Back when I was working at IBM and after I’d left Internal Audit, I was in marketing and became concerned that we were actively telling governments not to buy competitive products because we had something better coming. That typically wouldn’t be a problem, but we had killed that entire effort, and there really wasn’t anything coming, let alone “something better.”</p>\n<p>I met with the head of marketing and pointed out that I thought this was incredibly unethical and probably unhealthy because governments not only don’t have a sense of humor when you lie to them, but they can make your life a living hell if they find out — and it is pretty hard to conceal a promised product that has been terminated. IBM is one of the most ethical companies in the world, and he responded, “You don’t understand, Rob. This is marketing!”</p>\n<p>Well, I’ve spent much of my advanced education in marketing and have a degree in it, and I can categorically say that isn’t true. I resigned shortly after that, and that CMO was fired (with a little help from me). But it stuck with me that a lot of folks, particularly engineers, equate marketing with lying, and that typically ends badly for the customers first and the company shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>You can get away with doing this if you are able to provide the solution before people find out you weren’t telling the truth. This approach has seen success in some high-profile cases, but it failed for Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, showcasing that <a href=\"https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/01/30/theranos-the-limits-of-the-fake-it-till-you-make-it-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“fake it till you make it”</a> has some rather severe downsides if you can’t execute.</p>\n<p>It’s bad when a CEO does this, but potentially even worse if an executive in the company does it because then the CEO believes the lie and can be held accountable for it.</p>\n<h3>AMD/HP and Function Over Form</h3>\n<p>There is an even more frequent problem in our industry: Some companies are so afraid of the first problem that they over-pivot. Even though they have a massive competitive advantage, they don’t want to aggressively pitch it because they are worried they might be overselling it.</p>\n<p>These companies underperform financially because this is not a “build it, and they will come” market. If you don’t market your advantage, you won’t get credit for it. Years ago, AMD was burned because it over-promoted an underperforming product and almost went out of business, so it is now understandably gun-shy.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>However, when it comes to competing with Intel in the workstation segment, according to HP — which buys heavily from both AMD and Intel — AMD at the same price provides better battery life and performance.</p>\n<p>We saw this play out when Lenovo took AMD’s impressive consumer Threadripper processor, put it in a workstation, and grabbed the top-end of the workstation market from Dell. Engineers buy workstations, and they tend to do their due diligence and were amazed at how good this part was.</p>\n<p>AMD’s image is that it is a cheaper, lower-performing alternative to Intel. But this part is neither cheaper nor underperforming. HP launched its AI-focused Threadripper workstation that runs on Nvidia graphics at its Amplify conference, and Nvidia’s CEO was selling the heck out of it. (Piece of advice: Never, ever speak after Jensen Huang. The guy is amazing on stage.)</p>\n<h3>Windows 95, Jensen Huang, and AI</h3>\n<p>One of the interesting things Huang said was that HP’s AI-focused PC and workstation line and its marketing effort around it is a Windows 95 moment in that it would change PCs forever — and I agree with one enormous difference.</p>\n<p>Windows 95 had an initial $400 million launch budget which had people lined up around the block to buy the product. While Microsoft later cut that budget because the company couldn’t support that kind of demand, it still highlights what is possible if the marketing effort aligns with the product.</p>\n<p>Every leading tech CEO who took the stage more than suggested this AI effort was a massive game-changer, potentially far greater than Windows 95 could have been back then, given the state of technology. Yet the same demand isn’t being generated.</p>\n<p>Typically, with any modern technology, we’ll argue that you’ll get something like a 10% productivity increase. Wharton did a study with last-generation AI showing it was more like 80%, meaning that companies that deploy AI effectively will outstrip their competitors faster than they can respond unless they, too, embrace AI.</p>\n<p>These are quite literally company life-or-death products, but folks are thinking of them as a typical annual product cycle even though they are anything but.</p>\n<h3>The Unique Issue HP Is Addressing</h3>\n<p>The problem with all AI offerings is that too few people understand AI, including the vendors that make it and especially those that sell it. Both Nvidia’s and Google’s CEOs pointed this out on stage.</p>\n<p>Huang is so excited about HP because HP listened to that warning. Its plan began with internal training, so HP is becoming an AI expert and has already deployed or is deploying it widely in the company. HP is also rolling out certification and training programs to ensure its channel (it is uniquely 85% indirect) and that customers are well trained.</p>\n<p>So, it has hardware, services, software, training, and certifications. This coverage assures HP customers won’t be like most customers with failed AI deployments because one or more of those elements don’t exist.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: The Ryan Reynolds ‘Green Lantern’ Conundrum</h3>\n<p>Assuming that few of you have seen “Green Lantern,” I’ll use “Dune” as the example here.</p>\n<p>“Dune” is massively successful, but the older “Dune” movie that wasn’t successful was better. The difference was not how the movies were created but the lack of coupling between marketing and content.</p>\n<p>For marketing to work, it needs to be involved from the start and have some say on the content. If marketing is done right and properly staffed (there are way too many people with marketing titles who don’t know marketing), the campaign is built based on the knowledge of the audience.</p>\n<p>This same information should inform the production of the movie so the two form organically. The audience, or in the case of AI, the buyer, is excited about the product, and the product lives up to the hype, which is how you get a true hit.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>If I had my way, the marketing team would be involved with the product and ethically vetted from cradle to launch to ensure promotional effort matches the product’s potential, and the product matches the demand that marketing creates.</p>\n<p>The conundrum is that marketing people are often seen as dead weight during the creation of a product even though they, not the engineers, ensure the product’s success.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> I’ve often thought that what you need to do to correct this is to build the marketing campaign first, test it, and then build the product to match the campaign rather than what is typically done, which is to build the product in a vacuum and then throw it to marketing to promote it.</p>\n<p>Ironically, this may have been what is being done with the latest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZdGYG3NqSs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Deadpool”</a> movie (I’m a huge fan). I’m looking forward to seeing how that works out and hoping for a future Hal Jorden “Deadpool” crossover with Ryan Reynolds playing both roles. AI could make that happen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>HP Omen Transcend 14-Inch Laptop</h3>\n<p>What is the perfect PC? It should be different for everyone. For me, it’s the Qualcomm-based HP Elite Folio I use. For others, it might be something like the <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/omen-transcend-laptop-14-fb0097nr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP Omen Transcend 14-fb0097nr</a> notebook that blends significant performance with a massive sustainability story (much of the product is built from high-quality recycled materials) and a HyperX keyboard. The keyboard really caught my eye because my hands often slip off the navigation keys when gaming, leading to an avoidable death.</p>\n<p>This notebook has Intel’s latest AI-enhanced (NPU) Core 9 Ultra Processor, an amazing Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, and a reasonable (for a gaming notebook) $2,250 price.</p>\n<p>The HP Omen Transcend is pretty in person. It is colored in Shadow Black Aluminum and weighs a reasonable 3.6 lbs., which is exceptionally light for a gaming notebook.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/OMEN-Transcend.jpg\" alt=\"HP OMEN Transcend Laptop 14-fb0097nr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/OMEN-Transcend.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/OMEN-Transcend-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/OMEN-Transcend-768x438.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Omen Transcend Laptop 14-fb0097nr (Image Credit: HP)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When RTX graphics aren’t needed, it shifts to the Intel ARC graphics system, giving it up to 13 hours of video playback for movies and light work, which is impressive for a gaming notebook.</p>\n<p>This product provides a foundation for the coming AI content, including AI-driven NPCs, which I’m personally looking forward to. It also gives you a great platform to play on, learn AI on as desktop AI offerings roll to market, and impress your friends because you’ll have AI support before anyone else you know does.</p>\n<p>Granted, initially, much of what will use this AI subsystem is in early development, but this product is one of the first that is fully AI-ready. Thus, the HP Omen Transcend Laptop 14-inch is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Google joined the ranks of fellow cloud service providers Amazon and Microsoft on Tuesday with the announcement of custom silicon for its data centers.</p>\n<p>Google’s Axion line of processors represents its first Arm-based CPUs designed for the data center. “Axion delivers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency and will be available to Google Cloud customers later this year,” Amin Vahdat, the company’s vice president and general manager for machine learning systems and cloud AI, wrote in a company blog.</p>\n<p>According to Google, Axion processors combine the company’s silicon expertise with Arm’s highest-performing CPU cores to deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today and up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances.</p>\n<p>Google is the third of the big three cloud service providers to develop their own CPU designs, explained Bob O’Donnell, founder and chief analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.technalysisresearch.com/\">Technalysis Research</a>, a technology market research and consulting firm in Foster City, Calif.</p>\n<p>“All these companies want to have something that’s unique to them, something they can write their software to run on and to do things more power efficiently,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Data center power usage is one of their greatest costs, and Arm designs are generally more power efficient than Intel,” he continued. “Google’s not going to get rid of Intel, but Axion gives them a new option, and for certain types of workloads, it’s going to be a better alternative.”</p>\n<p>There are also market considerations. “Everyone wants an alternative to Nvidia,” O’Donnell said. “Nobody wants a company that has a 90% market share unless you’re the company with the 90% share.”</p>\n<h3>Bad News for Intel</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-lee-2274b5168/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benjamin Lee</a>, an engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, explained that Google can customize its hardware components for greater performance and efficiency by designing its own CPU.</p>\n<p>“Much of this efficiency comes from building custom controllers that handle important computation for security, networking, and hardware management,” he told TechNewsWorld. “By handling the bookkeeping computation required in data center servers, these custom hardware controllers free more of the CPU for user and customer computation.”</p>\n<p>The use of Arm processors in the data center is unfortunate news for Intel, which has historically dominated the data center market with its x86 processors, he noted.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Google-Axion-CPU.jpg\" alt=\"Google's Axion processor\" width=\"800\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Google-Axion-CPU.jpg 800w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Google-Axion-CPU-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Google-Axion-CPU-768x495.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>Google’s Axion processor (Image Credit: Google)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“This announcement shows an accelerating transition away from x86 architectures and more towards Arm for the server market, which is the ultimate prize for chip companies,” added <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodol/?originalSubdomain=uk \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rodolfo Rosini</a>, co-founder and CEO of Vaire, a reversible computing company with offices in Seattle and London.</p>\n<p>“I suspect Arm will get more out of this announcement than Google in the long run,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Rise of Proprietary Silicon</h3>\n<p>Axion is another example of major players — such as Apple and Tesla — investing in their own chip designs, observed Gaurav Gupta, vice president for semiconductors and electronics at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn.</p>\n<p>“We see this as a major trend,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We call it OEM Foundry Direct, where OEMs bypass or take assistance with design firms and go directly to the foundry to get their silicon.

We will continue to see more of this.”</p>\n<p>With this announcement, Google is putting its substantial financial and technical weight behind a market trend for semiconductors — like CPUs and accelerators — to be designed according to how they are going to be used, explained Shane Rau, a semiconductor analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a global market research company.</p>\n<p>“No single CPU or accelerator can handle all the workloads and applications that Google’s cloud customers have, so Google is bringing another choice for CPU and AI acceleration to them,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>TPU v5p General Availability</h3>\n<p>In addition to the Axion announcement, Google announced the general availability of Cloud TPU v5p, the company’s most powerful and scalable Tensor Processing Unit to date.</p>\n<p>The accelerator is built to train some of the largest and most demanding generative AI models, the company explained in a blog. A single TPU v5p pod contains 8,960 chips that run in unison — over 2x the chips in a TPU v4 pod — and can deliver over 2x higher FLOPS and 3x more high-bandwidth memory on a per-chip basis.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Google’s development of Tensor SoCs for its Pixel phones and the advancement of more powerful Tensor Processing Units for data center use underscore its commitment to accelerating machine learning workloads efficiently,” observed Dan deBeaubien, head of innovation at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sans.org\">SANS Institute</a>, a global cybersecurity training, education and certification organization.</p>\n<p>“This distinction highlights Google’s approach toward optimizing both mobile and data center environments for AI applications,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullahanwerahmed/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abdullah Anwer Ahmed</a>, founder of Serene Data Ops, a data management company in Dublin, Ohio, added that Google’s TPU adds another option for lower-cost inferencing to Google’s cloud.</p>\n<p>Inference costs are what users pay to run their machine-learning models in the cloud. Those costs can be as much as 90% of the total cost of running ML infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“If a startup is already using Google Cloud and their inferencing costs start to overtake training costs, it may be a suitable option to move to Google TPUs for a cost reduction, depending on the workload,” Ahmed told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Promoting Sustainability</h3>\n<p>In addition to improved performance, Google noted that its new Axion chips will contribute to its sustainability goals. “Beyond performance, customers want to operate more efficiently and meet their sustainability goals,” Vahdat wrote. “With Axion processors, customers can optimize for even more energy efficiency.”</p>\n<p>“Data centers use a lot of power since they run 24/7. Reducing power consumption does help contribute to sustainability,” Ahmed said.</p>\n<p>“The Arm-based CPU is much more energy efficient than the x86,” added O’Donnell. “That’s a huge deal because energy costs are enormous in these data centers. These companies have to work to reduce that. That’s one of the reasons they’re all leveraging Arm.”</p>\n<p>“As the demands for compute go higher, you can’t do that forever because there’s only so much capacity in the world, so you have to be smarter about it,” he added. “That’s what they’re all working to do.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Nearly two dozen dating apps were flagged by Mozilla’s <a href=\"https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Privacy Not Included</a> researchers Tuesday as failing to meet privacy and security standards, sharing customer data with third parties, and excluding the right of a user to wipe their data from the app.</p>\n<p>According to Mozilla, financial pressures are forcing the owners of the apps to change leadership, experiment with new features and subscription models, integrate AI, diversify income streams, gamify apps to make them more addictive, and siphon off more data from their users, while too often slacking on security.</p>\n<p>Eighty percent of dating apps share or sell their customers’ data and won’t guarantee all users the right to delete their data, the researchers noted.</p>\n<p>Dating apps tagged with Privacy Not Included cautions included Badoo, Black People Meet, BLK, Bumble, Christian Mingle, Coffee Meets Bagel, Elite Singles, Facebook Dating, Grindr, Her, Hinge, Jdate, Lovoo, Match, Muzz, OkCupid, OurTime, Plenty of Fish, Scruff, TanTan, Tinder and Zoosk.</p>\n<h3>Dating Apps Rejected by Gen Z</h3>\n<p>“The problem is the dating apps say they need to collect this personal information to help you find an ideal match, but they use that information far beyond the scope of what would help you find a partner,” said Privacy Not Included researcher and writer Zoë MacDonald.</p>\n<p>“They share and sell that information to advertisers,” she told TechNewsWorld. “And half of them don’t meet our minimum security standards. That means the data is at risk of a breach, leak, or hack, putting it up for grabs for just about anybody.”</p>\n<p>The Mozilla researchers maintain that dating apps are in a financial bind due to a drop in popularity. With millennials married off, Gen Z — younger, poorer, more tech-savvy, and less prone to casual sex — has become disenchanted with the apps, which has hurt the apps’ makers’ bottom line. According to the New York Times, the two biggest players in the domain — Match Group and Bumble — have lost US$40 billion in market value since 2021.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“As the first generation of digital natives, you might expect Gen Z to embrace dating apps, but the social anxiety this generation has been experiencing seems to hinder dating apps,” said Brian Prince, founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://topaitools.com\">Top AI Tools</a>, an AI tool, resource, and educational platform in Boca Raton, Fla.</p>\n<p>Prince cited a report from the dating app Hinge that found Gen Z is eschewing dating apps and even dating in general because of fear of rejection. “Putting themselves ‘out there’ online can be scary for a generation that has a hard time getting comfortable with being uncomfortable, so to speak,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“In general, it’s getting harder to find potential partners on dating apps, with catfishing and harassment running rampant,” he added. “Plus, apps tend to hide some of the best features behind a paywall, making it harder to make suitable connections.”</p>\n<h3>Gen Z Overwhelmed by Privacy Concerns</h3>\n<p>The pandemic might have also impacted Gen Z attitudes toward dating apps, suggested Ashley Johnson, senior policy manager at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itif.org/\">Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation</a> (ITIF), a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>“They were young adults during the Covid-19 pandemic and social distancing, so they may be seeking out more in-person connections now to make up for those years,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It’s also much easier than it used to be to connect with other people via online services other than dating apps, such as social media, so Gen Z may have less of a need for online services specifically meant for dating if they’re using more general-purpose services for all sorts of interactions, including romantic ones,” she said.</p>\n<p>Alicia diVittorio, a data privacy expert and advocate at <a href=\"https://www.datagrail.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DataGrail</a>, a data privacy company in San Francisco, added that research by her company shows that while Gen Z lives a large portion of their lives online, they are more sensitive to privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>“Younger generations are more aware and feel more overwhelmed about their online privacy,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Nearly 50% of Gen Z feels overwhelmed by privacy, compared to only a third of boomers.”</p>\n<p>“And,” she continued, “with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, younger generations are absolutely more fearful about how their data can be used.”</p>\n<h3>Collecting Too Much Geo Data</h3>\n<p>The Mozilla researchers also found that the majority of the apps studied collect users’ geolocation by default unless they opt-out. Other apps like Hinge, Tinder, OKCupid, Match, Plenty of Fish, BLK, and BlackPeopleMeet adamantly insist on accessing users’ precise geolocation data and can still collect this data whether someone is using the app or not, they added.</p>\n<p>“A lot of these apps want access to your location 24/7 whether or not the app needs that access to function,” Mozilla’s MacDonald said. “That’s a liability because that’s really sensitive information, and any time that’s transmitted over the internet, that’s going to put that information at risk.”</p>\n<p>Shared or stolen geolocation data could be particularly harmful to women in the wake of Roe v. Wade, maintained DataGrail’s diVittorio.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Part of the reason California settled with Sephora back in 2022 was because they were sharing the geolocation of women, and there were some concerns that information could make its way into the hands of people watching for women seeking abortions,” she explained.</p>\n<p>“In the Sephora case, which the company settled for $1.2 million, the state alleged that Sephora had violated the California Consumer Privacy Act by selling the personal information of customers without properly disclosing the practice or obtaining explicit consent.”</p>\n<h3>Necessary Feature or Safety Risk?</h3>\n<p>Frankly, this information can be found through countless other applications, so the threat posed here is specific to how the data is abused, asserted Ira Winkler, CISO of <a href=\"https://cyesec.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CYE</a>, a cybersecurity optimization company in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>\n<p>“Some dating apps allow users to know exactly where other users are in their immediate vicinity,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This allows malicious parties to find a user with basic information, and then quickly search other sites to gather much more information than possible and manipulate and abuse the other users.”</p>\n<p>“There are horror stories about users having their geolocation data misused,” acknowledged the ITIF’s Johnson. “However, geolocation data is important for dating apps. If users want to find others geographically close to them — if they are not interested in long-distance relationships and want to meet someone nearby — a dating app would need their geolocation data to match them with the right people.”</p>\n<p>“But,” she added, “there should be safeguards in place to protect that data from unauthorized use.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Project management (PM) software might be on its way to becoming an underappreciated technology gem across industries and enterprise environments. Analysts expect that by 2030, the market will exceed US$15.08 billion with a compound average growth rate of 10.68%.</p>\n<p>PM software helps organize time and resource management, creates business and employee performance reports, and better connects managers and leaders with strategy effectiveness. These platforms can also facilitate team collaboration.</p>\n<p>Not all PM platforms, however, are the same. Coordinate developed its product <a href=\"https://www.coordinatehq.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoordinateHQ</a> to deliver project management and universal collaboration through a simple client portal experience. The software removes the complexity and inefficiencies inherent in established PM solutions, making it easier for hybrid teams and their clients to work together.</p>\n<p>CoordinateHQ does this by eliminating the friction of communicating with a client through a mix of email, <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/sourcetable-ai-spreadsheet-aims-to-democratize-data-analytics-179677.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spreadsheets</a>, and messaging tools while trying to ensure teams execute and deliver. It also streamlines communication and automates processes for client service organizations to drive alignment and scale. In addition, CoordinateHQ integrates with other software like HubSpot.</p>\n<p>The project management market will continue to evolve in 2024 and beyond. It will produce innovations and new products that help companies break through the noise instead of adding to it, according to Rick Morrison, co-founder and CEO of CoordinateHQ.</p>\n<p>“It will continue to be noisy. We’re going to see tools arise that help teams work better together, especially across organizations, functional areas, and geographies,” Morrison told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Upstart Innovator on the Move</h3>\n<p>Morrison started his company to address a need he had personally experienced. Initially, the startup over-indexed on helping companies keep their clients’ goals a key priority. The founders then expanded into project management between clients and their customers.</p>\n<p>“The first live customers came in 2021. We have customers that have grown 10 times the size of their team, enabled by CoordinateHQ,” offered Morrison.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>In 2023, the company added features to help entire teams. These included automation via templates and workflows, improved UI, forms, time tracking, white label capabilities, e-signatures, and many more, all driven by its customers.</p>\n<p>“We started seeing real customer growth by revenue and customer count in 2022. We 4x’d revenue in 2023. In 2024, we’re continuing to partner with our customers to dictate product direction to make their lives easier,” said Morrison.</p>\n<h3>Peeling Back the Project Management Curtain</h3>\n<p>We asked Morrison to share his insight into what awaits around the corner and why project management can be an organization’s secret weapon.</p>\n<h4>TechNewsWorld: Why have some project management solutions failed to gain traction more rapidly?</h4>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179164\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179164\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Rick-Morrison.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Morrison, Coordinate\nFounder and CEO\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Rick-Morrison.jpg 200w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Rick-Morrison-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179164\"><span>Rick Morrison, CEO<br>\nat Coordinate </span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Rick Morrison:</strong> Many project management tools are very interchangeable. We all have to-do lists that we use personally; coming up with a communal to-do list across team members or organizations is challenging.</p>\n<p>One fundamental problem with adding another PM tool to the mix is the chance that workers will not be comfortable using it.</p>\n<p>For example, if you adapt to using new processes, then it works. But if you don’t, then it won’t. If you need to adapt to the tool and its processes, it will fail to be adopted, as no one has time for that.</p>\n<h4>What is driving the growth of the project management market?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> People are inundated with tools, emails, etc. However, they still have work they need to do. The current generation of tools makes things more difficult by being just one more thing that people need to do. Smarter tooling is becoming available to handle more heavy lifting than previous generations of PM tools. These new tools help streamline an organization’s tech stack and drive growth.</p>\n<h4>How should organizations evaluate PM software to ensure it helps your business scale?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> It’s not just about having features. It is about how the software will be used practically. This is especially true considering everybody already uses many tools and project management processes.</p>\n<p>The key to ensuring that a new PM tool will help your business scale is that it makes everybody’s life easier. If it adds complexity, it will fail to be adopted.</p>\n<h4>How can PM software help organizations that increasingly rely on a mix of employees and contractors?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> This is the key. You want your employees to be able to oversee all of their projects seamlessly. The same is the goal for clients. You want them to understand where they are and what they need to do, but ideally without needing to remember anything.</p>\n<p>For contractors, you need their help, but they will be involved at different levels. This goal is different for each contractor. If you just need contractor A to complete a task, then your PM tool should follow up with them in a simple way that is very easy for them to engage.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The software should simplify reminders and automation for them. As they get more involved in projects, then you can start increasing their access to the tools to make them more efficient and bring them in.</p>\n<p>PM tools that can handle a global workforce can be very helpful here. Contractors are often located in various countries and time zones.</p>\n<h4>How can PM solutions solve hybrid working situations in terms of functionality to accommodate a distributed team?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> When teams work remotely, they need better communication and collaboration. There are no water cooler conversations happening. Tools that help the team work asynchronously are vital with distributed teams.</p>\n<h4>Is artificial intelligence essential to PM/collaboration software?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> AI will help make everybody’s lives easier. However, it faces the risk of “garbage in, garbage out.” If you just blindly use AI’s output, it won’t be super useful. It’ll be very powerful for helping project managers be more effective when done right.</p>\n<h4>How does CoordinateHQ’s PM platform differ from other project management options like HubSpot, Monday.com, Smartsheet, Wrike, and Miro?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Ours [CoordinateHQ] is meant for projects that span organizations, teams, and such. It makes everybody’s life easier without forcing them to remember processes, passwords, etc. It seamlessly integrates with everybody’s workflows to help the project get done quicker and easier.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Our software integrates with the existing tech stack versus the other tools mentioned. If you were going to invite your biggest client to collaborate with you on one of the above, you would have to train them on how to use that tool, or at least your processes and expectations. They will need to remember this for it to be useful. Otherwise, it’s more trouble than it’s worth.</p>\n<p>For example, if you share Asana with your customers, you are going to spend a lot of time with each client teaching them Asana. Then, they have to remember how you specifically utilize Asana. This results in a lot of time being wasted. Additionally, Asana will be marketing itself to your clients.</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: Asana is a web service and mobile work management platform designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work. </em></p>\n<h4>What are the biggest challenges facing the growth of PM software?</h4>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> There is way too much noise. Something like traditional Asana, <a href=\"https://www.crmbuyer.com/story/monday-coms-new-tools-showcase-low-code-no-code-trend-in-crm-176579.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monday</a>, etc., may work well for your team, but the process completely breaks down as soon as you start working with other organizations and clients. If you’re resorting to sending emails or highlighting bits of previous emails to respond to them, then it is not helping you.</p>\n<p>As another example, if you cannot go on vacation without a major headache caused by handing over to-dos to your coworkers, or if you go on vacation and are getting interrupted while on the beach to help your team put out fires, there is a better way. This is what we have built CoordinateHQ for.</p>\n",

These attacks will likely leverage a wide range of techniques, ranging from sophisticated botnets and ransomware to credential stuffing and account takeovers, social engineering, and other forms of online fraud.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Vincent Strubel, who heads France’s national cybersecurity agency, ANSSI, told the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-cybersecurity-cyberattacks-russia-a2fef5133e4ea142bfcb4111d987ff50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Associated Press</a> that the expected cyberthreat levels targeting the 2024 Summer Games are unprecedented. The agency is bracing for a torrent of malicious activity far exceeding the estimated 450 million cyberattacks that hit the Tokyo Olympics infrastructure in 2020.</p>\n<p>“There will be cyberattacks during the Games and the Paralympics,” Strubel said at a briefing in May. “Some won’t be serious. Some will be serious but won’t have an impact on the Games. And perhaps there will be some that are serious and liable to have an impact on the Games.”</p>\n<h3>Cybersecurity Preparedness for the 2024 Olympics</h3>\n<p>“The Olympics present a unique challenge due to the sheer volume of digital interactions,” warned Marie Vandewalle, a threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, adding, “Businesses must invest in advanced threat detection and response systems to stay ahead of cybercriminals.”</p>\n<p>Jake Moore from <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eset.com/\">ESET</a>, another security software provider, emphasized the need for “multi-layered security approaches, including user education and real-time monitoring.”</p>\n<p>DataDome, which has headquarters in France and the United States, is already offering French companies a <a href=\"https://datadome.co/products/premium-soc-platform-support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">premium version of its new SOC</a> (security operations center) monitoring service, to help counter the Olympic-sized threat volume.</p>\n<p>“The 2024 Olympics period promises to be crucial in terms of cybersecurity,” noted DataDome Chief Strategy Officer Benjamin Barrier. “The cyberthreat will be considerable because the Games will attract the attention of the whole world to France and represent a ‘golden’ opportunity for cybercriminals to come and disrupt the party. DataDome’s SOC service allows cybersecurity teams to detect and remediate threats before they cause significant impact to business operations,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Additional tactics businesses can adopt to help deter and defend against expected attacks include deploying advanced bot detection and mitigation strategies, enhancing account security with multi-factor authentication (MFA), and protecting digital marketing investments against ad fraud.</p>\n<p>Understanding the threat landscape and implementing robust security solutions is crucial for businesses to navigate large-scale events like the 2024 Olympics unscathed.

      "content": "<p>After attending the HP Amplify Partner Conference 2024 in Las Vegas last week for three days, I can state unequivocally that I have rarely participated in a technology event where my initial reaction changed so dramatically within the first 24 hours.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, HP’s Amplify event annually showcases its latest technologies and innovations to empower partners and customers in the digital age. The show serves as a platform for HP to demonstrate its vision for the future of technology and its role in shaping a more inclusive and sustainable world.</p>\n<p>With that as a backdrop, the first day didn’t exactly knock me off my feet, as the keynotes lacked significant substance or major product news. The company leadership clarified that HP is embracing AI in a full-throated and consequential manner.</p>\n<p>Fellow CEOs Pat Gelsinger from Intel, Qualcomm’s Cristiano Amon, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai added big-name star power with short real-time interviews with HP CEO Enrique Lores. They spoke about their respective companies’ commitments to maximizing the AI business opportunity, but little substance was offered about <em>how</em>.</p>\n<p>HP’s urgency in making a strategic pivot to embracing AI was evident on the first day of the conference; however, specific proof points and what the company would do about it were hard to find.</p>\n<p>Then came the second day.</p>\n<h3>HP’s Second Act</h3>\n<p>Things got a bit more interesting on day two. An onstage interview with the always entertaining Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang energized the crowd with his colorful framing of the AI business opportunity with Nvidia-powered HP workstations that drive tremendous efficiency in AI-based content creation.</p>\n<p>Following the Huang interview, the event took off with a tour de force presentation by HP President of Personal Systems Alex Cho, which defined the essence of this year’s Amplify. In my view, Cho gave the most passionate, erudite articulation of the AI value proposition for business customers of any senior technology device company I’ve encountered.</p>\n<p>Cho introduced a new generation of AI-powered business laptops, desktops, and workstations, which he believes will spark a race to revitalize the PC market. He claimed it’s the largest-ever portfolio of “AI PCs” with new devices built to enable new generative artificial intelligence workloads in a hybrid workspace. These devices featured the latest AI processor solutions from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Cho’s observation that this AI revolution is not about speeds and feeds is a welcome rebuttal of how most tech companies typically market and message their products.</p>\n<p>Instead, it’s activated by use cases, personas, and experiences, Cho noted, stating that the AI revolution will not purely be an outcome of technology alone. Instead, Cho mentioned, “[HP] is changing the world’s fundamental proficiency, productivity, and creativity.”</p>\n<p>Cho chatted about several compelling developments this year, particularly HP’s product leadership in AI PCs and workstations.</p>\n<p>HP cited 30% higher performance and better battery life for AMD-based mobile workstations than Intel, which earned the most design wins. This point is a big deal since large language models, or LLMs, are the essence of generative AI applications and are generally developed on desktops.</p>\n<h3>AI Studio Shakes Things Up</h3>\n<p>The announcement of HP’s Nvidia-based AI Studio immediately captured my attention. AI Studio closes a significant gap in building gen AI apps and goes another step in managing team rights and duties. This latter element is quite interesting as gen AI development requires the work of multiple individuals.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Z by HP Studio workflow screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-screenshot.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-screenshot-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-screenshot-768x502.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>HP’s AI Studio console (Image Credit: HP)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Companies interested in deploying gen AI applications are scrambling to maintain costs, as LLMs can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop. AI Studio is a significant antidote for companies that want to make LLM development quicker, less expensive, and better.</p>\n<h3>Developing LLMs Is Costly, Often Bureaucratic</h3>\n<p>So, what differentiates AI Studio from similar offerings in the AI space? It’s important to recall that, for the most part, only Nvidia and IBM had “complete stack” solutions before the release of HP’s workstation announcements at Amplify. Nvidia, for its part, has had to build its own special and expensive workstations.</p>\n<p>The sophisticated nature of LLMs requires unique security protocols, which are complicated and necessitate particular multi-user collaborative requirements, making traditional software management insufficient.</p>\n<p>While HP, to its credit, has been transparent about using AI internally, the company is new to AI and doesn’t come to the tip of the tongue as a software expert. However, HP has demonstrated several flashes of excellence over the past few years, especially with its HP Wolf Security software and HP Smart app, which have attracted millions of downloads.</p>\n<p>HP’s work with Nvidia on AI Studio has been critical as the partnership has produced a balanced AI collaboration and management solution. The result is a tool that allows data engineers to focus on the AI project, which is the software handling the bureaucratic administrative and reporting portion.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-workflow.jpg\" alt=\"Z by HP Studio workflow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-workflow.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-workflow-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Z-by-HP-AI-Studio-workflow-768x468.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Z by HP AI Studio is a single platform that brings together data, people, and compute for AI model development. (Image Credit: HP)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>\n<p>From a general business perspective, HP’s pivot to AI is easy to understand, given that industry analysts expect a “supercycle” of PC upgrades in the second half of 2024 as more AI PCs join the market, along with a Windows 11 refresh following the post-Covid period downturn.</p>\n<p>Of course, HP is among numerous PC suppliers using AI to differentiate their products for consumers and companies. Still, following Amplify, its business messaging stands out for its precision and meticulousness.</p>\n<p>Moreover, HP Amplify was the first event I attended that laid the groundwork for compelling and ROI-driven reasons to seek out a business PC or workstation with AI ingredients.</p>\n<p>Alex Cho deserves special credit for making that case so enthusiastically and straightforwardly, eschewing some ambiguous and obtuse claims that have begun to plague many companies’ efforts to market AI.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Of course, the HP Amplify event is focused almost entirely on the company’s business and corporate engagements with its customers. HP presented a well-thought-out and deliberate plan to engage its business customers with AI solutions, though it has much work to do with consumers.</p>\n<p>While Microsoft and its Copilot initiative in Windows 11 will do most of the heavy lifting to convince consumers that an AI-embedded PC is worth upgrading, the jury is still out.</p>\n<p>The HP Amplify announcements were not limited to the AI client portfolio outlined above. HP revealed partner-related programs to help its channel partners with training and AI-based enhancements to HP’s Poly lineup. A particularly interesting Poly videoconferencing AI-related feature announced at Amplify eliminates the “bowling alley” effect that plagues conference calls in a rectangular table setup.</p>\n<p>HP VP of Design &amp; Sustainability Stacy Wolff gave an excellent presentation on the company’s magnificent work in making its product packaging more sustainable and planet-friendly, which often goes unappreciated despite HP’s enormous printer consumables business.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/HP-Amplify-Stacy-Wolff.jpg\" alt=\"HP VP of Design &amp; Sustainability Stacy Wolf at Amplify 2024\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/HP-Amplify-Stacy-Wolff.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/HP-Amplify-Stacy-Wolff-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/HP-Amplify-Stacy-Wolff-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>HP VP of Design &amp; Sustainability Stacy Wolff emphasized the company’s commitment to eco-friendly practices. (Photo by Author)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>However, taking the long view, HP succeeded at the business level in convincing some more skeptical observers that the 76-year-old company can still innovate, pivot, and re-invent itself.</p>\n<p>More work needs to be done to message the tangible benefits of local AI in PCs beyond security and reduced latency, but that can be left to another day. The year’s HP Amplify event proved the truth of the adage that a bit of patience can sometimes be worth the wait.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Ransomware attacks have shown signs of decreasing in recent months. Yet they still pose enough threat for organizations to rethink whether a successful breach of their computers justifies paying a ransom demand in hopes attackers will not divulge their stolen content.</p>\n<p>According to the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/\">NCC Group</a> <a href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/newsroom/ncc-group-monthly-threat-pulse-review-of-april-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Threat Pulse Report</a> released in May, the ransomware landscape remains turbulent despite fewer reported incidents since April. Industrials (34%) and Consumer Cyclicals (18%) remained the first and second-most targeted sectors.</p>\n<p>There has been a significant shake-up among the top 10 ransomware actors since April. Hunters, one of the leading bad actors, moved from eighth to the second most active threat actor. It launched 61% more ransomware attacks in April than in March. RansomHub replaced RA Group in third place and saw a 42% increase in attacks over March.</p>\n<p>The policy of not paying ransom, often called a “no concessions” policy, is a widely debated strategy in counterterrorism and hostage situations. Its effectiveness continues to be argued from multiple perspectives. Cybersecurity experts apply the same reasoning when deciding whether to make or not make ransomware payments.</p>\n<p>Some argue that paying ransomware demands finances future criminal activity. Legal considerations are also part of the decision equation. In some countries, paying ransom to terrorists is illegal. Others say similar laws are needed to help curb ransomware crime.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, no federal law in the United States makes paying ransomware demands illegal. However, making such payments comes with significant legal and financial risks.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind a “no concessions” policy is that eliminating the financial incentive for cybercriminals could decrease the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks, according to Anne Cutler, cybersecurity evangelist at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>.</p>\n<p>“However, this approach, while commendable, presents real-world challenges for organizations,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>No-Pay Ransomware Strategy is Gaining Support</h3>\n<p>Cybersecurity experts and government officials have long supported the policy of not paying ransoms due to its potential to curb criminal activity and reduce attacks, noted Cutler. Paying ransoms is risky and unreliable and does not guarantee that cybercriminals will restore access or decrypt files.</p>\n<p>“Cybersecurity insurance companies are increasingly excluding ransomware payments from coverage, enticing organizations to invest more heavily in proactive preventative measures,” she added.</p>\n<p>Cutler offered Japan’s strategy as a pertinent example. Nikkei Cross Tech and Japan <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us\">Proofpoint</a> report that Japanese organizations maintain a notably low rate of ransom payments compared to other countries. Despite a surge in ransomware incidents through 2023, the first half of 2024 has seen a slight decline, according to the Metropolitan Police Department’s Threats in Cyberspace Report.</p>\n<p>“While it is not clear if this decrease is directly related to Japan’s low payment rate, it suggests that minimizing ransom payments could influence overall ransomware activity,” she explained.</p>\n<h3>Challenges Enforcing Ransomware Payment Bans</h3>\n<p>Craig Jones, vice president of security operations at Ontinue, admitted that cyber experts discuss the pros and cons of banning ransom payments to combat ransomware. But that is a multifaceted proposition.</p>\n<p>“While it could dishearten attackers by cutting off their financial incentives, enforcing such a ban is difficult, especially with the anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>In critical situations, organizations may still choose to pay ransoms covertly to recover vital data or restore operations, undermining the ban’s effectiveness, he added.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Jones views a more well-rounded approach as potentially more effective. He favors enhancing cybersecurity defenses, promoting international cooperation to track and prosecute cybercriminals, and regulating the cyber insurance industry.</p>\n<p>“This multilayered strategy addresses the root causes and consequences of ransomware without the significant enforcement challenges and potential negative consequences of a ban,” he reasoned.</p>\n<p>“Such an approach acknowledges the complexities and the global nature of cyber threats, offering a balanced solution to mitigate ransomware risks.”</p>\n<h3>‘No Concessions’ Ransomware Policy Risks and Realities</h3>\n<p>In theory, no payment clauses try to disrupt the profitability of cybercrime by denying attackers their desired outcome. However, applying this strategy universally can be challenging, warned Jason Soroko, senior vice president of product at <a href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sectigo</a>. His company offers comprehensive certificate lifecycle management (CLM) services.</p>\n<p>“While banning ransomware payments might deter attacks over time, it also puts victims, especially critical infrastructure, in a precarious position, potentially leading to severe disruptions,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Legal frameworks prohibiting payments would need to be carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences, he suggested. This includes forcing organizations to operate in secrecy or exacerbating the damage during an active attack.</p>\n<p>“The balance between disincentivizing crime and protecting essential services is delicate,” he observed.</p>\n<h3>Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Employee Training</h3>\n<p>Employee training and education on cybersecurity best practices are crucial for protecting an organization from evolving cyber threats, countered Patrick Tiquet, vice president for security and architecture at Keeper Security.</p>\n<p>“Employees are the first line of defense. Regular training sessions should emphasize the importance of vigilance when receiving unsolicited multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts,” he asserted.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This education process should focus on training employees to question unexpected notifications immediately and report any suspicious activity without delay. Simulated phishing attacks and push notification exercises can effectively help employees recognize and respond to threats, Tiquet noted.</p>\n<p>“Fostering a culture where employees feel comfortable reporting potential security issues without fear of reprimand is essential for timely threat detection and response,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Tips to Avoid Ransomware Payment Dilemmas</h3>\n<p>Ngoc Bui, a cybersecurity expert at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.menlosecurity.com/\">Menlo Security</a>, argues that paying ransoms should not be illegal anywhere. While it might incentivize threat actors, not paying could be more damaging, especially for organizations involved in critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“The disruption from ransomware can be catastrophic, and organizations must prioritize protecting operations and stakeholders. Organizations that suffer a ransomware attack should also use it as a learning opportunity to adjust their security measures and ensure they are using actionable intelligence to do so,” said Bui.</p>\n<p>A primary strategy for avoiding the pay-or-do-no-pay question is proactively preventing ransomware attacks. Tiquet recommends companies manage third-party contractor security. Start by conducting thorough background checks and security assessments to ensure contractors meet stringent standards before granting access to sensitive systems.</p>\n<p>“Once contractors are onboarded, applying the principle of least privilege is critical to an organization’s security,” he said.</p>\n<p>This approach means granting them only the minimum access necessary for their specific tasks and roles within the organization. Regular audits of third-party access are crucial to detect any unusual or unauthorized activities early on, enabling prompt action to mitigate potential risks and breaches.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Since Friday, organizations have been struggling to get their operations up and running after a software update by security vendor <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a> set off an epidemic of “blue screens of death” globally, commonly known as the screen of death for Windows users.</p>\n<p>On Monday, global technology advisory firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a> released a research note outlining short-term, intermediate, and long-term measures CrowdStrike users can implement to deal with what’s become the update from hell.</p>\n<p>One of the firm’s recommendations for immediate action is to make sure security teams are on the lookout for new threat intelligence related to opportunistic attacks. “In panic mode, people begin clutching at straws,” explained Sumed Barde, head of product at <a href=\"https://simbian.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simbian</a>, an AI security company in Mountain View, Calif.</p>\n<p>“They’re looking for any help they can get online,” he told TechNewsWorld. “So what we’re seeing is a bunch of fake websites popping up by scammers.”</p>\n<p>Barde explained that one form of scam is a website that does nothing but demands upfront payments. Other websites offer free advice but contain malware.</p>\n<p>Chris Morales, CISO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.netenrich.com/\">Netenrich</a>, a security operations center services provider in San Jose, Calif., cited several kinds of opportunistic attacks organizations should be on high alert for during this initial period of the CrowdStrike outage. “Phishing campaigns are big,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Attackers love to take advantage of the confusion by sending emails that look like they’re from CrowdStrike or related companies.”</p>\n<p>“Credential stuffing and brute-force attacks are common, too, as attackers try to exploit any temporary security gaps,” he added.</p>\n<p>“And, of course, there’s always the risk of known vulnerabilities being targeted more aggressively during the chaos,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Potential for Ransomware Surge</h3>\n<p>The outage may also fuel another online scourge. “Ransomware attacks could surge as attackers leverage the weakened security postures of affected organizations,” said Tim Freestone, chief strategy and marketing officer of <a href=\"https://www.kiteworks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kiteworks</a>, a secure content communications provider in San Mateo, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Data exfiltration attempts may increase, targeting the temporarily vulnerable systems,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The outage might also inspire DDoS attacks to further overwhelm already strained networks.”</p>\n<p>Invitations for opportunistic exploits by hackers may also be created as security operations center teams implement ad hoc measures to get systems operational quickly.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“One of the biggest things for SOCs is going to be to ensure that any temporary systems, temporary permission elevations or other workarounds that have been put into place have been decommissioned,” observed Josh Thorngren, a security strategist at <a href=\"https://www.mayhem.security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ForAllSecure</a>, a software security testing company in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>“When there’s activity on these devices or networks two weeks from now, that’s likely to be a problem,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Gartner also made some recommendations for midterm actions. “The focus for midterm actions is to assess the impact on secondary systems, look for exposed vulnerabilities, and ensure you have visibility into planned systemwide updates and releases in the coming week,” it explained.</p>\n<h3>Manage Fatigue and Burnout</h3>\n<p>Among the midterm actions suggested by Gartner was for organizations to review anomalies or unusual trends with the SOC teams to minimize the risks of an undetected opportunistic attack.</p>\n<p>“SOC teams should be on the lookout for unusual amounts of data going into or being taken out of repositories, higher-than-usual access requests, users seemingly requesting access to files or drives they don’t usually want or need to access, and any changes in permissions or configurations that don’t fit into previous baselines or trends,” said Katie Teitler-Santullo, a cybersecurity strategist for <a href=\"https://www.ox.security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OX Security</a>, a developer of active application security posture management platforms, in Tel Aviv, Israel</p>\n<p>“IT and security teams can also help their organizations by adding any known fake domains, like crowdstrikebluescreen[.]com or crowdstrike-helpdesk[.]com, to their blocklists to prevent users from inadvertently visiting those sites,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Another midterm action proposed by Gartner is actively managing employee burnout and fatigue. “This outage goes beyond security teams because it touches every single machine in a company,” noted Gartner Senior Director Analyst Jon Amato.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“That creates a laborious, time-consuming, tedious process,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The help desk staffs at most businesses right now are strained to the breaking point. I’m hearing about companies hiring armies of contractors coming to touch machines and working 24/7. The longer that goes on, the more likely you’re going to have fatigue set in. It’s a recipe for burnout.”</p>\n<p>Morales explained that burnout and fatigue are huge issues during events like the CrowdStrike outage and are often overlooked. “Think about it,” he said. “Our security teams are suddenly dealing with a massive surge in workload. They’re trying to manage the incident response while keeping all the regular operations going. It’s like trying to put out a fire while still cooking dinner.”</p>\n<p>“This kind of prolonged stress can lead to serious decision fatigue, where the quality of choices starts to nosedive,” he continued. “Tired employees might miss critical alerts or subtle signs of an attack.”</p>\n<p>“And let’s face it,” he added, “we’re all humans — the chances of making a mistake skyrocket when you’re exhausted. One small error could lead to a misconfiguration or a delayed response, and suddenly, we’ve got a much bigger problem on our hands.”</p>\n<h3>Resiliency for the Long-Term</h3>\n<p>Gartner’s long-term actions aim to mitigate or reduce the risk of future events like the CrowdStrike event. “The CrowdStrike outage reinforces the need to focus on resilience,” Gartner noted, and recommended, “Use a top-down approach to connect the approach to overall strategic objectives.”</p>\n<p>“For all the efforts to prevent such mistakes from happening again, we should anticipate that these cascading errors will increase in frequency and impact in the years to come as the world becomes even more interconnected and interdependent,” said Maurice Uenuma, vice president and general manager at the <a href=\"https://www.blancco.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blancco Technology Group</a>, a global company that specializes in data erasure and mobile device diagnostics</p>\n<p>“Because of this, we must focus on resilience — the ability to survive and recover when the inevitable crisis comes,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Resilience is achieved by having separate, redundant ways to perform critical tasks, ensuring continuous backup of data, building alternate communication channels, and rehearsing for operating with diminished capabilities under adverse conditions,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“If companies want to be more resilient, they must first have full oversight and awareness of their supply chain,” added Jenna Wells, chief customer and product officer at <a href=\"https://www.supplywisdom.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supply Wisdom</a>, a real-time risk intelligence platform in New York City.</p>\n<p>“If you have full oversight and awareness of your supply chain, you are saving time and increasing your resilience by already knowing your points of failure,” she told TechNewsWorld. “You can then proactively put a business continuity plan in place for when events do happen.”</p>\n<p>“Whether it be a cyber event — or, as in this case, a human error — you need to be able to react in any type of incident with the snap of a finger,” she said. “After all, it’s not if but when an event happens.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A new approach to cybersecurity education may help produce qualified cyber experts with real-life training.</p>\n<p>Colleges and universities are starting to offer specialized undergraduate courses in cybersecurity as part of their computer science degrees. However, these programs often lack hands-on training in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>It is not uncommon for corporate employers to complain about graduates applying for IT jobs without any hands-on cyber experience, according to Steve Zuromski, CIO at <a href=\"https://www.bridgew.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bridgewater State University</a>. This gap drove officials to create a unique cyber training program to fill that void.</p>\n<p>With the demand for cyber jobs through the roof, students often lack interest or awareness of the need for this training, even within dedicated computer degree programs. The unique approach bridges the gap and gives students hands-on practical experience.</p>\n<p>“We know there is really a national and, frankly, worldwide crisis concerning cyber. That is where our role is. That is where we fit in — building and diversifying the talent pipeline in Massachusetts,” Zuromski told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Comprehensive Cyber Training for All Ages</h3>\n<p>The cyber training efforts, however, do not aim at only attracting university-level students, offered Michelle Stanfield, director of Bridgewater’s Cyber Range. Not only is it a resource for degree-seeking students, but its fully functional Cyber Range is also a resource to ensure the entire community gains a better cyber perspective.</p>\n<p>The cyber facilities staff works with different municipalities and anyone with an initial career thinking about upskilling through its certification programs. The Cyber Center also works with K-12 programming to acquaint students with cybersecurity at the earliest stages.</p>\n<p>“They have the opportunity to learn and be exposed to a field they may not know anything about,” Stanfield told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>This cyber program, called CASE, includes Bridgewater’s Center for the Advancement of STEM Education. Bridgewater State developed a module for high school students who can come into the Cyber Range lab for four to five hours to participate in an immersive experience, she added.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater’s Cyber Range and the Security Operations Center (SOC) serve two separate purposes, according to Zuromski.</p>\n<p>The Cyber Range is virtual. It provides students and other external groups the ability to come in and train in a protected space. The lab creates different cybersecurity crisis scenarios that mimic attacks found in the wild. It allows people to train in a safe virtualized environment where they cannot hurt anything.</p>\n<p>The SOC, a separate physical facility on the campus, is designed in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cybertrustmass.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CyberTrust Massachusetts</a>. That center, staffed with CTM’s staff and Bridgewater’s cyber students, monitors live events from municipalities and nonprofits.</p>\n<h3>Cybersecurity Bootcamp Simulations for Real-World Readiness</h3>\n<p>The Cyber Range offers visiting students and participants from external organizations a five-hour mockup experience few will soon forget. It also turns on their interest in the need for cybersecurity, Zuromski noted.</p>\n<p>They come into the range acting as the cybersecurity team for a video game. The company soon comes under a ransomware attack. They come to Bridgewater State, sit down, and suddenly an attack happens. The lights go from green to red. The desks shake a bit, so a sense of panic gets them excited.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-students.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Bridgewater State University Cyber Range receive real-world cybersecurity training\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-students.jpg 800w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-students-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-students-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>During this experience, they figure out how the attack occurred. Then, they need to make a plan and report to the CEO and board. The plan needs to include what happened, how we can prevent this from happening again, and whether the company should pay the ransom, explained Zuromski.</p>\n<p>“It really is a state-of-the-art facility designed to train people. Not just in the room, but we can also train people remotely at the same time. We can reach a very wide audience here and mimic what it is like for corporate customers,” he observed.</p>\n<p>The best part of Bridgewater’s on-premises cyber training is the practical experience of working in the SOC. Students receive high-quality, affordable, and accessible cyber education. They gain practical experience in a safe virtualized environment at the Cyber Range. Then, they go into the SOC and get the actual live experience, all before they graduate.</p>\n<p>“Plus, it benefits those municipalities and nonprofits that did not have that protection to begin with. So it is a win-win all around,” said Zuromski.</p>\n<h3>State-of-the-Art Cyber Training Facility</h3>\n<p>The range spans 1,200 square feet, featuring 24 workstations and dual-screen monitors. Fully grant-funded by the federal, state, and local governments, it cost nearly US$4 million.</p>\n<p>The facility includes stadium-style seating, an 18-foot by seven-foot ultra-high-definition video wall, video cameras throughout, and confidence monitors on the sides and back.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-facility.jpg\" alt=\"Bridgewater State University Cyber Range facility\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-facility.jpg 800w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-facility-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Bridgewater-State-Cyber-Range-facility-768x442.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>A control room in the back houses students or other professional staff working to help control the room’s theatrics. Lighting integrated throughout the ceiling grid and at the back of the room provides a halo effect around the giant video wall.</p>\n<p>“We even have lighting around the ribbon, a top ribbon banner on the top, and integrated throughout the furniture within the room. All really kind of designed to deliver that immersive cybersecurity training experience,” said Zuromski.</p>\n<h3>Expanding Cyber Training Programs</h3>\n<p>According to Stanfield, Bridgewater is building out its catalog of offerings for external audiences and expects to be available this summer. That new program will include an extensive catalog of experiences from cyber team sins — an activity where teams come together to figure out how to solve anything from ransomware to DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>“We also fully intend to be able to do individual training. So, for example, if companies feel that their security professionals need to learn a specific skill, we will be able to offer that as well,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The hard-core academic side of cybersecurity is also growing, Zuromski noted. The Massachusetts Board of Higher Education recently approved offering a full cybersecurity curriculum as a degree.</p>\n<p>The university has already received over 200 applications for the bachelor’s degree program starting this fall.</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The images featured in this article are courtesy of Bridgewater State University.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Brute force cracking of passwords takes longer now than in the past, but the good news is not a cause for celebration, according to the latest annual audit of password cracking times released Tuesday by <a href=\"https://www.hivesystems.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hive Systems</a>.</p>\n<p>Depending on the length of the password and its composition — the mix of numbers, letters, and special characters — a password can be cracked instantly or take half a dozen eons to decipher.</p>\n<p>For example, four-, five-, or six-number-only passwords can be cracked instantly with today’s computers, while an 18-character password consisting of numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and symbols would take 19 quintillion years to break.</p>\n<p>Last year, Hive’s research found that some 11-character passwords could be cracked instantaneously using brute force. This year’s findings revealed the effectiveness of newer industry-standard password hashing algorithms — like bcrypt — for encrypting passwords in databases. Now, that same 11-character password takes 10 hours to crack.</p>\n<p>“In years past, companies were using MD5 encryption to hash passwords, which isn’t very secure or robust. Now they’re using bcrypt, which is more robust,” explained Hive CEO and Co-founder Alex Nette.</p>\n<p>“The good news is websites and companies are making good decisions to use more robust password-hashing algorithms, so cracking times are going up,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but given the increases in computer power, those times will start to go down again, as they have in years past.”</p>\n<h3>Encryption Tradeoffs</h3>\n<p>While hashing passwords with strong encryption is a good security practice, there are tradeoffs. “Encryption slows things down,” Nette noted. “Bcrypt is more secure, but if you create too many iterations of the hashing, it could make it slow to log into a website or make the site load slower.”</p>\n<p>“If we had the best encryption in place, a website could be totally unusable for users on the internet, so there’s usually a compromise,” he added. “That compromise could end up being an opportunity for hackers.”</p>\n<p>“Bcrypt delivers a 56-byte hash versus a 16-byte for MD5, which accounts for the much stronger resistance to brute force attacks,” noted Jason Soroko, senior vice president of product for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\">Sectigo</a>, a global digital certificate provider.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“MD5 is still in wide usage and will probably continue to be, especially for large password databases due to the smaller and more efficient size,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>MJ Kaufmann, an author and instructor with <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">O’Reilly Media</a>, an operator of a learning platform for technology professionals, in Boston, acknowledged that stronger hashing algorithms have played a role in making it harder to crack passwords, but maintained that it only helps organizations that have changed their code to adopt the algorithms.</p>\n<p>“As this change is time-consuming and may require significant updates for compatibility, the shift is slow, with many organizations still using weaker algorithms for the near future,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Worst Case Scenario for Hackers</h3>\n<p>Kaufmann noted that great strides have been made in recent times to protect data. “Organizations have finally started to take data protection seriously, partially due to regulations such as GDPR, which has effectively given more power to consumers through harsh penalties to companies,” she explained.</p>\n<p>“Because of this,” she continued, “many organizations have expanded their data protection across the board in anticipation of future regulations.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/password-cracking-times-large.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

hackers to crack passwords, cracking isn’t as important to them as it used to be. “Cracking passwords is not that important to adversaries,” Kaufmann said. “In general, attackers look for the path of least resistance in an attack, frequently accomplished by stealing passwords through phishing or leveraging passwords stolen from other attacks.”</p>\n<p>“As fun as it is to measure the amount of time it takes to brute force hashed passwords, it is critical to understand that keylogging malware and credential harvesting by social engineering tactics account for a huge number of stolen username and password incidents,” added Sectigo’s Soroko.</p>\n<p>“The study also makes the point that password reuse renders all brute force methods unnecessary for the attacker,” he added.</p>\n<p>Nette acknowledged that Hive’s table of password-cracking times represents a worst-case scenario for a hacker. “It assumes a hacker was unable to get someone’s password through other techniques, and they have to brute force a password,” he said. “The other techniques could make the time to get a password lower, if not instantly.”</p>\n<h3>Log In, Don’t Break In</h3>\n<p>“Cracking passwords has remained an important form of compromise for attackers, but as password encryption standards increase, other methods of compromise such as phishing become even more appealing than they already are,” added Adam Neel, a threat detection engineer at <a href=\"https://www.criticalstart.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Critical Start</a>, a national cybersecurity services company.</p>\n<p>“If it is likely that the average password will take months or even years to crack, then attackers will take the route of least resistance,” he told TechNewsWorld. “With the assistance of AI, social engineering has become even more accessible to attackers through the form of crafting convincing emails and messages.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Gates, a security subject matter expert at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.horizon3.ai/\">Horizon3 AI</a>, maker of an autonomous penetration testing solution, in San Francisco, noted that today, hackers don’t have to hack into systems; they log in.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Through stolen credentials via phishing attacks, third-party breaches — that include credentials — and the dreaded credential reuse problem, credentials are still the number one issue we see as the method attackers use to gain footholds in an organizations’ networks,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Also, there’s a tendency among administrative users to choose weak passwords or reuse the same passwords across multiple accounts, creating risks that attackers can and have exploited,” he added.</p>\n<p>“In addition,” he continued, “some levels of admin or IT-type accounts are not always subject to password reset or length policy requirements. This rather lax approach to credential management could stem from a lack of awareness about how attackers often use low-level credentials to get high-level gains.”</p>\n<h3>Passwords Here To Stay</h3>\n<p>The simple way to eliminate the password cracking problem would be to eliminate passwords, but that doesn’t look likely. “Passwords are intrinsic to the way our modern lives function across every network, device, and account,” declared Darren Guccione, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“Nonetheless,” he continued, “it’s vital to acknowledge that passkeys will not supplant passwords in the near future, if ever. Among the billions of websites in existence, only a fraction of a percent currently offer support for passkeys. This extremely limited adoption can be attributed to various factors, including the level of support from underlying platforms, the need for website adjustments, and the requirement for user-initiated configuration.”</p>\n<p>“While we inch closer to a passwordless or hybrid future, the transition is not a one-size-fits-all approach,” he said. “Businesses need to carefully assess their security requirements, regulatory constraints, and user needs to identify and implement effective, practical password alternatives.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Microsoft aims to boost the PC market with artificial intelligence and Windows 11, but a collateral consequence of those moves could be an early trip to a landfill for many computers.</p>\n<p>“Windows 11 itself does not directly contribute to e-waste,” said Kieren Jessop, an analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.canalys.com/\">Canalys</a>, a global market research company. “However, due to its hardware requirements, it can indirectly increase e-waste,” he told TechNewsWorld. “A significant share of the global installed base is unable to upgrade to Win11 because of the TPM 2.0 chip, which contributes to Win11’s security.”</p>\n<p>He noted that Canalys estimates approximately 20% of the global Windows installed base can’t upgrade its over 200 million devices.</p>\n<p>Most of those devices run Windows 10, which Microsoft will stop supporting in October 2025. “Those devices don’t become obsolete after Win10’s end of support,” Jessop observed. “And consumers are partially unbothered about running an obsolete Windows version. However, for businesses with older PCs, the Win10 EoS will drive many to purchase new devices.”</p>\n<h3>240M PCs Headed to the Dump</h3>\n<p>Jessop and fellow analyst Ben Caddy released a report in December that estimated about a fifth of the world’s Windows 10 devices — some 240 million PCs — will become e-waste by the time Microsoft ends support for Windows 10.</p>\n<p>Most of these 240 million PCs, if in good condition, could at least be recycled. However, the report noted that their incompatibility with the latest supported version of Windows massively reduces their value for refurbishing and reselling.</p>\n<p>Many of the 240 million PCs will still be usable for years to come, but demand for devices no longer supported by Microsoft will be minimal — even companies with the tightest of IT budgets will be deterred by the lack of free and continued security updates, it added.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Organizations with fleets of perfectly viable Windows 10 PCs will be driven to prematurely retire their devices once the OS vendor drops support — especially continued security updates — for their devices,” Caddy told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Although Microsoft is offering an Extended Security Updates program for three years after the Win10 end-of-service date, Caddy said the high price tag makes extending the life of Win10 PCs even more unappealing.</p>\n<p>The price for the first year of updates is US$61 per Windows 10 device. It goes up to $122 for the second year and $244 for year three.</p>\n<h3>Bonanza for Landfills</h3>\n<p>“Companies prefer having their devices always provided with the latest security updates and features, so even if operational, older hardware is considered obsolete,” said Jacob Kalvo, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://liveproxies.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Live Proxies</a>, a proxy solutions provider based in Studio City, Calif.</p>\n<p>He explained that Microsoft significantly increased the hardware requirements for Windows 11 over Windows 10. “That means a large number of PCs capable of running every daily application but failing on Windows 11 specifications are at risk of being dumped,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>The end of Win10 support will not only be a bonanza for landfills. “Because of the significant demand during Covid, many business’ PC fleets are due for a refresh,” Jessop explained.</p>\n<p>That, coupled with the end of support for Windows 10, will drive PC sales in the coming months. “A Canalys survey of channel partners found that 73% of partners expect the Win10 EoS to impact their customers’ refresh plans in the next 12 months,” Jessop said.</p>\n<p>Even if Microsoft weren’t ending Win10 support, the rise of artificial intelligence is making Win10 hardware obsolete. “If AI-driven applications and features become the norm, then older PCs will not be able to run them efficiently,” Kalvo said.</p>\n<p>That will be increasingly the case as more AI functionality moves from the cloud to the device. “The ability for AI PCs to do on-device inferencing provides several advantages, including lower cost per query, reduced latency, unlimited personalization, improved availability — no internet connection required — and enhanced privacy and security,” Jessop noted.</p>\n<p>He added that AI inferencing can be 75% more cost-effective when performed on-prem compared to the cloud and that 83% of enterprise CIOs anticipate repatriating workloads from the public cloud this year for AI purposes.</p>\n<h3>Cascading PCs</h3>\n<p>However, Russ Ernst, CTO of <a href=\"https://www.blancco.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blancco Technology Group</a>, a global company that specializes in data erasure and mobile device diagnostics, maintained that companies are trying to get more mileage out of their old hardware, not less.</p>\n<p>“There’s a push right now in the corporate enterprise to keep machines for longer,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There’s a drive to move away from a strict three-year lifecycle and hold on to machines for four, five years or longer. Some OEMs, like HP, are starting to think of a seven-year lifecycle. That’s incredibly long.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Traditionally, if you had a three-year lifespan on a machine, that’s all you looked at,” he continued. “Now organizations are going to be challenged to look at system requirements beyond time.”</p>\n<p>One way to extend the life of hardware is through “cascading,” which requires knowledge of the computing demands of the various units in the business. “I can’t cascade a machine from marketing to engineering. The system requirements are incompatible,” he said. “But I can cascade a machine from engineering to marketing.”</p>\n<h3>Sustainability Lesson</h3>\n<p>The scale of the e-waste produced by the end of support for Windows 10 highlights the role of device vendors and OS vendors alike in maximizing products’ usable lifespans, the Canalys report noted.</p>\n<p>To facilitate the circular economy, it added, OEMs must embed durability, repairability and recyclability into the design of their devices — and OS vendors must ensure these devices are usable and secure for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>“While vendors have a role in reducing e-waste, the responsibility is shared among manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers,” Jessop said. “Vendors can contribute by designing products for longevity, offering repair services, and providing software updates for extended periods. However, consumers also play a crucial role in making informed purchase decisions and properly disposing of devices.”</p>\n<p>“AI PCs have prompted many vendors to have multi-pronged marketing campaigns that focus on AI, but also the sustainability of their new hardware,” he noted.</p>\n<p>Caddy pointed out that the lifespan of devices is subject to the buying and replacing cycles of consumers, as well as organizations’ own IT procurement cycles. “But,” he said, “PC vendors have the responsibility of ensuring devices function effectively for as long as possible. This involves designing devices to be durable, easy to disassemble, and repair on the hardware side.”</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “the lifespan of a device is also heavily influenced by the actions of OS vendors such as Microsoft and Apple. The end of support for an operating system can force robust, repairable, and functioning devices to be prematurely retired, often owing to the security concerns of using an outdated OS.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Having Google I/O immediately followed by Microsoft Build, with both conferences focused on AI, provided an interesting contrast between the two companies’ approaches to AI. Microsoft is all about PCs for AI integration, while Google is all about smartphones.</p>\n<p>As I sat in the Microsoft audience waiting for the keynote, there were no PCs in sight, but when the keynote started, most of us got out our PCs because smartphones are not useful for writing. We don’t need one or the other. We need both.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the two tech companies backing up the Microsoft announcement were not Intel or AMD but Qualcomm on the PC and Nvidia in the cloud. This once again showcased that if those two companies could put aside their animosity and cooperate more closely with each other, they likely could secure their AI futures. They are both exposed as AMD and Intel ramp up to compete and as companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, OpenAI, and Amazon ramp up their own internal hardware efforts.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about AI this week, and we’ll close with what I think is the best of the notebook computers coming to market that uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite.</p>\n<h3>PC or Smartphone?</h3>\n<p>If you watched Google I/O, you saw a compelling demonstration of how your smartphone could be the most convenient way to interact with AI. Your smartphone is always with you, its camera is easy to use, and it can more effectively learn about your personal life to create AIs that better match your unique needs.</p>\n<p>Microsoft highlighted its AI in the PC, which learns from your work habits, digital communications, gaming activities, professional interests, skills, and capabilities. The PC remains your work interface, and the AI learns how you deal with long-form communication to improve its understanding of your processes, skills, and capabilities.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Google’s approach should improve your personal life, while Microsoft’s should enhance your professional life. However, you are not solely one or the other; you are both. Therefore, for the AI to truly know you and be most effective at working and playing with you, it needs to engage with you professionally and personally.</p>\n<p>You will want an AI that is consistent across both platforms. So, both Google and Microsoft are exposed to a future competitor that can bridge both platforms or produce a new device that can be effective personally, like a smartphone, and professionally, like a PC.</p>\n<p>In a weird way, right now, as I mentioned above about Qualcomm and Nvidia, the most beneficial approach for users is for Google and Microsoft to collaborate rather than compete, as their efforts complement each other.</p>\n<h3>Quality Over Performance</h3>\n<p>One of the things that concerns me more about Microsoft’s approach compared to Google’s is the lack of a focus on quality. If you have quality issues (and everyone has quality issues) and you increase speed without addressing those quality issues, you will make more mistakes. If those mistakes propagate into AI systems, their frequency and impact will increase dramatically.</p>\n<p>The industry is approaching this backward by focusing on performance increases rather than quality issues. With people like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang arguing that you do not need to learn how to code, the ability to find these mistakes is decreasing while the number of errors is increasing as we increase speed. There is a real possibility we will eventually have quality issues that accelerate faster than we can mitigate them. I am already seeing a significant reduction in quality as companies ramp up AI.</p>\n<p>The reason I am focusing on Microsoft here is not because it has a lower focus on quality than Google but because Microsoft’s focus on development and creation makes the quality problem far more dangerous. Google’s demonstrations did not include coding. What its users created was more in line with entertainment, while Microsoft’s tools are used to build buildings, design vehicles, and create new AIs. Thus, the risks of this problem are greater in Microsoft’s work, so it has a higher quality requirement than Google’s based on the two companies’ presentations.</p>\n<h3>AI Benefits</h3>\n<p>Microsoft displayed a different and very compelling set of AI use cases. From helping the blind by using the AI’s ability to describe what it is seeing and providing direction and descriptions based on that sight to giving a person with paraplegia the ability to talk and move, it was a particularly compelling demonstration.</p>\n<p>It could help teachers be more effective while freeing up their time to focus more on individual students, and it could even help a father learn how to play Minecraft with his young son. I found the focus on teachers particularly compelling because they are critical to assuring future generations. Then, there was the training aspect of the tool, and the gaming demonstration really caught my interest.</p>\n<p>This last was particularly interesting because I often lose interest in a new video game because, during the initial learning phase, picking up the unique aspects of the game, for me, is more like work than fun. But I know I will enjoy the game more if I can get through that learning phase. In story-based games, there are times I just want to move forward in the story without spending a ton of time on a particular puzzle aspect of the game.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In addition, it is often more helpful to have a coach rather than an online guide to get you over the hump, and that is what Microsoft demonstrated: an AI coach that behaved and sounded like a human that could see what you are seeing and guide you toward a more successful, and for me, a more fun gaming experience. This would remove a lot of my trepidation when buying a new game, with the result being I am more likely to buy more games if they have this function.</p>\n<p>Office 365 is heavily adopting Copilot, allowing you to create presentations from documents automatically. It might be far more effective to draft a document when creating a presentation than jumping into PowerPoint directly.</p>\n<p>I have often wanted to learn Adobe’s tools so I could use them to create better pictures and movies, but the learning curve is steep. With AI, the learning curve is significantly reduced, making it much more likely that I could become immediately productive with the product.</p>\n<p>With AI, onboarding to even the most challenging tool will become much easier, which could be huge for companies like Adobe that have powerful tools but have been limited in sales by customer fear of the related learning curve.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Our Approach to AI May Be Critically Wrong</h3>\n<p>I mentioned that we are overly focused on speed, not quality. I will add that this is where we have the greatest need for AI: decision support. This quality vs. speed issue is an example of that. For instance, earlier this year, the board of OpenAI fired their CEO. That ended badly. Their decision was well-founded but not well-thought-through. Instead of making OpenAI safer, their failure has arguably made the company less safe. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>We often make decisions that, had we thought them through, we would have made differently or not made at all. We are all smarter in hindsight, but AI could help us avoid many of our critical mistakes.</p>\n<p>In a way, this takes us back to quality. Rather than initially focusing AI on making us more productive, shouldn’t we focus it on helping us create a better, happier life?

Gold, founder and principal analyst of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jgoldassociates.com/\">J.Gold Associates</a>, an IT advisory company, in Northborough, Mass.</p>\n<p>“If you’re moving from an Arm chip on a smartphone to a Nvidia chip in a data center with an app, there’s a lot of effort involved because you’re working with two different architectures,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Intel Strives To Regain Market Share</h3>\n<p>With its sixth-generation Xeon chip, Intel hopes to regain some of its lost share in the data center market. According to Reuters, Intel’s share of that market for x86 chips declined 5.6 percentage points over the past year to 76.4%, with AMD now holding 23.6% of the pie.</p>\n<p>“Data center computing is Intel’s most important market, and continued advances in performance and power efficiency will be critical,” Penn’s Lee explained.</p>\n<p>“The concern is that general-purpose processor design, like the Xeon, is increasingly commoditized,” he continued. “Engineers throughout the industry know how to define and refine these designs.”</p>\n<p>“Moreover,” he added, “advantages in performance and power depend not only on the design but also the transistors used to build that design. Competitors, such as AMD, are also designing data center processors and building them with advanced transistors, leading to increased competition in this space.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/intel-xeon-6-e-cores.jpg\" alt=\"Intel Xeon 6 E-cores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/intel-xeon-6-e-cores.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/intel-xeon-6-e-cores-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/intel-xeon-6-e-cores-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>For companies updating their infrastructure, Intel Xeon 6 with Efficient cores (E-cores) enables 3-to-1 rack-level consolidation to reduce costs and save space. (Credit: Intel)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Shane Rau, a semiconductor analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a global market research company, noted that the new Xeon chips come in two flavors, the 6700 and 6900 series, each offering different combinations of performance and power consumption. “This product segmentation acknowledges that end-user workloads are diversifying and, depending on what workload an end-user has, they may need primarily performance or to balance performance and power consumption,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“So,” he continued, “Intel is expanding the kinds of workloads it can serve and trying to improve its competitive position against vendors of other data center processor types, including CPUs and GPUs from AMD and server GPUs from Nvidia.”</p>\n<p>“More specifically, Intel is trying to position its server microprocessors to take on more AI-based workloads by themselves so that end-users won’t feel that they have to buy a separate server GPU to accelerate those workloads,” he said.</p>\n<h3>High Hopes for Lunar Lake</h3>\n<p>Intel also has high hopes for Lunar Lake. “Intel has reason to believe that Lunar Lake might catapult them back into a leadership position against Qualcomm and AMD,” Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Lunar Lake chips feature advanced AI integration at the hardware level, optimized for AI workloads, setting them apart from AMD’s and Nvidia’s more traditional approaches, he explained.</p>\n<p>The architecture also promises superior performance per watt, focusing on energy efficiency, potentially outperforming AMD’s Ryzen and Nvidia’s Grace CPU in sustained workloads, Vena added, and it’s supported by a comprehensive software ecosystem for AI development, competing directly with Nvidia’s CUDA and AMD’s ROCm platforms.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Unlike Nvidia, which primarily targets data center applications, Lunar Lake chips are designed for consumer PCs, making AI-powered applications more accessible to everyday users,” he said. “Intel’s push with Lunar Lake could pressure AMD and Nvidia to enhance AI integration in their consumer products, driving competition and innovation in the AI PC market.”</p>\n<p>Gold predicted that 65% to 75% of PCs in the market will be AI-enabled within two to three years, maybe even higher in the enterprise as they upgrade their machines. “So what Intel is doing in that space is important,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But Lunar Lake isn’t just about AI,” he added. “It’s about significantly reducing power requirements because [consumers] want thin and light machines with batteries that last two days, three days, a week.”</p>\n<h3>Addressing Power Shortages in AI’s Future</h3>\n<p>Power is going to be a looming issue in AI’s future, maintained Deborah Perry Piscione, co-founder and CEO of the <a href=\"https://work3.me \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Work3 Institute</a>, a research and advisory services provider in San Francisco. “One of the most important investments will need to be in our 40-year-old energy infrastructure,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Policymakers are going to need to move fast on supporting AI development and not be behind the eight ball like we were with fabs for semiconductors,” she continued. “We all paid the price with the semiconductor shortage during Covid, and we will continue to pay the price on our energy grid.”</p>\n<p>“The success of AI development and our ability to consume it is all a big ‘if’ right now,” she said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I participated in a podcast last week. One of the other panelists was Moses Ma from <a href=\"https://futurelabconsulting.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FutureLab</a>. FutureLab has a project called Manhattan 2, referencing the Manhattan Project for nuclear bomb development. However, this project is focused on helping, not killing people, and on the need to develop a human-centric approach to AI deployment that assures people have productive lives rather than being homeless and unemployable, which is, sadly, the path we are on currently.</p>\n<p>Another company I met with is <a href=\"https://www.levelex.com\">Level Ex</a>, which uses video game technology developed by video game programmers and subject matter experts to spin up human employees for new jobs and tasks in a matter of hours, not years. This could potentially enable people to compete better with AI.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss how we could have a better post-AI future this week. We’ll close with my Product of the Week, the impressive new iPad Pro, which is, by a significant margin, the best tablet in the market right now.</p>\n<h3>The AI-Jobs Problem</h3>\n<p>Every Industrial Revolution has created concerns about lost jobs, and those concerns have abated with the jobs created by the recent technology, which worked out well eventually. I say eventually because there have been a lot of issues with the transitions, particularly with older workers who may lack the time or interest to be retrained, often leading to spikes in unemployment.</p>\n<p>But this latest AI Industrial Revolution is hugely different because we aren’t automating a process so much as we are creating technology to replace individual people. <a href=\"https://www.cognition.ai/introducing-devin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devin</a> is a case in point. It is an AI employee that is on the market to fill an actual job. Rather than hire a human, you can just buy Devin.</p>\n<p>AI and robots are not just being created to fill new jobs. They are being made to fill jobs where there are shortages. Long-haul drivers, for instance, who are in very short supply, are being supplemented and potentially replaced by self-driving trucks.</p>\n<p>In addition, fast-food restaurants, where staffing post-pandemic has been tough, are looking at replacing all the employees with robots and AI. I haven’t tried one of these automated burger joints myself yet, but I did try the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/future-coffee-powered-dell-technologies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">automated Barista</a> created by Dell a few years ago, and it was, quite honestly, the best cup of coffee I’d ever had from a store. Even back then, robots and AI could do many things better than people.</p>\n<p>But where are the big job openings in our AI future? Won’t they be the jobs this future creates because no one does those jobs today? So why wouldn’t companies spin up AIs in hours rather than retrain humans over years?</p>\n<p>More importantly, who will buy the goods that companies make if we replace most or all workers with AI and robots? AI and robots have no income. For now, they are programmed to do specific tasks. They don’t need to eat, have homes, or commute to work.</p>\n<h3>FutureLab’s Manhattan 2 Project</h3>\n<p>Manhattan 2 is a fascinating project that outlines a plan to ensure future AI development and deployment that enhances employees and minimizes displacement at scale.</p>\n<p>What seems to set this project apart is that the plan puts employees, not AIs, at the center of the effort. Most AI deployments just focus on the AI part; if it displaces people, well, that is just a side effect that is, unfortunately, way too common.</p>\n<p>The new jobs will be AI-related, so people will need to improve their AI skills quickly. It will be similar to learning a new language or musical instrument. For instance, I’ve wanted to learn how to play the piano but have been unwilling to put in the effort, and I expect there are many folks out there like me. We’ll talk about making the learning process easier in a moment.</p>\n<p>The Manhattan 2 project lays out the critical requirements for progress. FutureLab provides a hands-on VC approach that blends financial assistance with practices that help various companies create more human-centric AI services that wrap their AI products.</p>\n<p>The elements include hands-on learning, a tight focus on creativity, a directed focus from the technology to its practical application, peer coaching for the companies participating in the program, progress tracking, and a unique solution for those with ADHD to help their focus skills. There is a product called <a href=\"https://www.brainstormbot.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BrainstormBot</a> that is AI-based and can be applied to both startups and universities to help with this learning process.</p>\n<p>Manhattan 2 is an impressive effort.</p>\n<h3>Level Ex</h3>\n<p>Level Ex is one of the most interesting training programs I’ve seen. Imagine learning a skill from a video game. In fact, imagine if most of your applied education was in video games, and imagine if the knowledge behind the video game could be used to train people <em>and</em> AIs.</p>\n<p>What Level Ex has been doing is mainly focused on doctors. It uses games that allow doctors to pick up specialties in two hours, knowledge that normally takes one or two years to master. It was developed for the Mars mission because they realized that if someone were injured, they couldn’t ship a hospital and entire staff to Mars, and getting help remotely from Earth would be difficult due to latency and data rate issues.</p>\n<p>In that scenario, the Mars medical officer would spin up an AI to help diagnose the problem. Then, after directing the doctor on any immediately necessary remediation, the officer would advise and serve up a video game-based training program that would make the doctor an expert in the needed procedure.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine using this tool to spin up employees on AI skills. Rather than spending months or years to transition an employee, you would spend hours.</p>\n<p>Instead of traditional book and lecture methods, employees are learning through video games. This approach not only demonstrates skills but also allows them to be practiced in simulations.</p>\n<p>Initial mistakes, which are expected, cause no real damage. Employees can experiment with different processes and decisions, exploring alternative outcomes without risking their jobs or careers.</p>\n<p>Any time you need to retrain, employees can just play a different game. I’ve heard that the doctors who use this tool like the games so much they often play them just to kill time. Can you imagine doing something you’d typically do for leisure and fun and magically making yourself more valuable as an employee?</p>\n<p>The Level Ex training program is incredible.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: A Better Future</h3>\n<p>We are approaching a significant catastrophe of massive unemployment coupled with an equally enormous lack of jobs to employ those who have been displaced. In addition, the rate of change not only means that most people who are now in school will find their education wasn’t adequate for the available jobs, but they will be unable to change their skill set fast enough to be competitive with AIs and robots. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>That doesn’t have to be the case. Using the outline from the Manhattan 2 project coupled with the game-based training of Level Ex, not only can we create plans and opportunities that mitigate this employment risk, but we can also make people far more competitive with AIs, significantly reducing the chance they will be unemployable while translating the tedium of training to the fun of gaming.</p>\n<p>Retraining doesn’t sound fun to me at all, but I’m a gamer. I like playing video games that are interesting, and having a game that is fun to play and relevant to my career would be unbelievably awesome.</p>\n<p>We can have a better future. We just have to make that a priority. Tools like those from FutureLab and Level Ex will help make that better future possible.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The New iPad Pro</h3>\n<p>If you know me, you know I’m not an Apple fan, but Apple does have some impressive products. Right now, the Apple Watch is arguably the best device of its type in the market.</p>\n<p>While the iPad once represented a threat to the PC — a threat that Microsoft countered poorly with its Surface — it never fully realized its potential, often resembling a limited PC more than a breakthrough device. The latest <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPad Pro</a> has knocked it out of the park.</p>\n<p>I’d argue that because of this new iPad Pro, the Mac is, for now, at least, the poorer sibling. The iPad Pro is awesome! I have no idea how Apple packed this much performance and more than adequate battery life in this thin product.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Pro.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iPad Pro 11-inch and 13-inch models\" width=\"1000\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Pro.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Pro-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Pro-768x362.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The new iPad Pro 11-inch and 13-inch models are both available in space black and silver. The keyboard is sold separately. (Image Credit: Apple)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>OMG, the display is like my own wish list for the perfect tablet display. Typically, you can get great color or outdoor viewability, but not both. Not anymore. The iPad Pro not only has a wonderful OLED display, but it is powerful enough to use outside.</p>\n<p>I am a tad concerned about how long this display will last since OLEDs at normal power wear out far faster than LCDs, and the extra power should accelerate that process — though we won’t know for sure until these have been in the market for a while. Some early testers have complained about color accuracy, but, to me, this device is simply fantastic!</p>\n<p>The M4 chip is also impressive. While the new Qualcomm Snapdragon X is better on paper, the M4 comes closer than any other part currently being used in tablets.</p>\n<p>The iPad Pro has better keyboard options, haptics, and a better stylus option, the new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Pencil Pro</a> than any prior iPad models. Some of these features are also compatible with the iPad Air.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Pencil Pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-768x372.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of the iPad Pro with a new magnetic interface. (Image Credit: Apple)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Additionally, it outperforms the current Surface line, which Microsoft developed specifically to compete with the iPad Pro. (I still wonder if Microsoft plans to discontinue the Surface because it really isn’t marketing that line anymore).</p>\n<p>In the end, I’m more than impressed with the new Apple iPad Pro. At least for now, nothing comes even close to what this product has and can do, so the new iPad Pro is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Website impersonation scams have become a growing problem, although many businesses aren’t happy with the tools they have to address them.</p>\n<p>A study released Tuesday by digital risk protection solutions company <a href=\"https://www.memcyco.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Memcyco</a> found that nearly three-quarters of businesses have deployed a digital impersonation protection solution to avert online scams, but only 6% of those organizations are satisfied that it protects them and their customers. “That’s really shocking,” Memcyco CMO Eran Tsur told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>According to the study, more than two-thirds of businesses (68%) know their websites are being impersonated, and almost half (44%) know this directly impacts their customers. The study is based on a survey of 200 full-time director-to-C-level employees in the security, fraud, digital, and web industries in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>“A spoofed website can lead to significant financial losses for customers if they are tricked into providing login credentials or sensitive personal information,” said Matthew Corwin, managing director of <a href=\"https://guidepostsolutions.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guidepost Solutions</a>, a global security, compliance, and investigations firm.</p>\n<p>“Brand reputation can be severely damaged if customers fall victim to scams perpetrated through an impersonated website, eroding trust in the company,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>A website impersonation scam can harm more than a company’s reputation. “There can also be direct financial losses from fraud, as well as indirect costs related to remediation, legal fees, and possibly some customer compensation,” Ted Miracco, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.approov.io/\">Approov</a> Mobile Security, a global mobile application security company, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Leaning on Customer Reports for Detection</h3>\n<p>The study also found that the most common way two-thirds (66%) of the surveyed companies became aware of website impersonation attacks was through incident reports from affected customers. “That’s unbelievable,” Tsur said. “Not only are the deployed solutions not protecting against or preventing these attacks, the organizations don’t have a clue whether these attacks have taken place or not.”</p>\n<p><a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://guidepostsolutions.com\">Guidepost Solutions</a>’ Corwin noted that businesses that depend primarily on customer reports to detect impersonation scams might miss out on crucial early warnings and the opportunity to defend against emerging threats proactively. “A reactive approach puts the burden on customers, which can damage customer relationships and trust,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Learning about scams from customers means the attack has already impacted individuals, causing harm before mitigation even begins,” added Approov’s Miracco. “Regular scans are the only alternative that might take down fake websites that mimic a brand, but this is challenging, as you have to anticipate events before they occur.”</p>\n<p>“Working from customer reports is a reactive approach, not a proactive one,” he said. I’m not sure an adequate defense exists yet, so users need to be educated and more careful before responding to emails that look legitimate.”</p>\n<p>An even more worrying finding of the study is that over 37% of businesses said they first become aware of fake websites when customers affected by phishing-related scams publicize their experience on social media, a practice known as “brand shaming.”</p>\n<p>The study questioned how much longer businesses can afford to rely on customers as their main source of threat intelligence with AI and phishing kits increasingly available off-the-shelf.</p>\n<p>“With these kits, everything is fully automated,” Memcyco’s Tsur observed. “You can launch it and forget it.”</p>\n<h3>Cybersecurity’s Worst Nightmare</h3>\n<p>Corwin explained that the accessibility of AI-driven tools and pre-packaged phish kits means even less technically skilled individuals can execute convincing impersonation attacks. “AI-enhanced phishing tools can mimic legitimate websites more accurately, deceiving even the most vigilant users and amplifying the threat landscape,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Often,” he continued, “cybercriminals will also leverage domain names that appear nearly the same as the legitimate address of a company or brand but contain slight variations or errors, known as ‘combosquatting’ or ‘typosquatting.'”</p>\n<p>“AI is very dangerous,” added Miracco. “These tools are so easy to use, even for individuals with no technical skills, allowing virtually anyone to create sophisticated phishing campaigns. It’s our worst cybersecurity nightmare come true — hand-delivered by companies that talk about how wonderful AI will be. Sadly, the early adopters of most technologies are bad actors.”</p>\n<p>Patrick Harr, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a network security company in Pleasanton, Calif., noted that website impersonations have existed since the web was born.</p>\n<p>“These were typically easy to spot by almost any user,” he said. “What has changed recently is two things — phishers are squatting on legitimate domains, and phishers are using phishing kits and AI to generate near-perfect website pages.”</p>\n<p>“Without AI computer vision countermeasures, these are very difficult to discern and will make the threat actors more successful, not less,” he maintained.</p>\n<h3>Strategies To Combat Website Impersonation Scams</h3>\n<p>Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla., recommended that every company sending emails implement DMARC, SPF, and DKIM, which are global anti-phishing standards. “They attempt to defeat malicious emails and links claiming to be from the legitimate sending domain,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“For example,” he explained, “If I get an email claiming to be from Microsoft, the receiver’s email server/client can use DMARC, SPF, and DKIM to see if the email actually originated from Microsoft.”</p>\n<p>Miracco recommended that company websites ensure all web traffic is encrypted with SSL/TLS certificates to make it harder for attackers to intercept and spoof communications.</p>\n<p>He added that mobile applications should implement attestation mechanisms to verify their integrity and ensure that interactions with backend APIs only originate from legitimate, unaltered instances of the app. They should also hire threat intelligence services that can monitor for phishing kits, fake domains, and other indicators of impersonation.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>To counter tactics like typosquatting, Corwin noted that companies can register obvious variations or likely misspellings of existing domains, including hyphenated names, other popular domain extensions, and characters slightly out of order.</p>\n<p>“There are brand monitoring services that will monitor for phishing sites and new domains which contain company intellectual property, and some will even help with automated domain takedown services,” he said. “These may help some companies, but unfortunately, because there are so many potential variations of domain names and current tools make it so easy to create these phishing sites, the risk is likely to persist.”</p>\n<p>Miracco added that companies should not only focus on technological defenses but also foster a culture of security awareness among employees and customers.</p>\n<p>“Website impersonation scams are a rapidly evolving threat that requires a multi-faceted approach,” he said. AI has enabled this problem, and hopefully, in the near future, we will be deploying AI-enabled solutions that can preempt users from making costly mistakes with a fake site.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple and Google are huddling over a potential deal to bring the search king’s Gemini generative AI offerings to the iPhone.</p>\n<p>The negotiations, first reported by Bloomberg on Monday, aim to let Apple license Gemini’s set of AI models to drive some new features for the iPhone later this year.</p>\n<p>While a deal would give Gemini a key edge with billions of potential users, Bloomberg noted, it also may be a sign that Apple isn’t as far along with its AI efforts as some might have hoped.</p>\n<p>“Apple appears to be behind its competitors in addressing generative AI, and this is partly because the pace of innovation has been so high that the timings of its yearly developer conference in summer and product release in autumn have created a mismatch at the current pace in the AI race,” said Paul Schell, an industry analyst with global technology intelligence firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abiresearch.com/\">ABI Research</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been busy developing its AI chops. “Behind the scenes, Apple has been busy developing its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies that will help it advance that technology — most recently with the acquisition of DarwinAI,” Schell told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Apple also has a Machine Learning Research division devoted to advancing its capabilities in the area, and Tim Cook has talked up generative AI in anticipation of iOS 18,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Part of Overall AI Strategy</h3>\n<p>“Apple is way behind on AI,” declared Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“That’s kind of amazing,” he told TechNewsWorld, “since Siri was one of the first digital assistants in the market, but once they launched it, they seemed to lose interest, which is why they are so far behind.”</p>\n<p>A deal with Google could mesh with Apple’s overall AI strategy, noted William Kerwin, an equity analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“Apple has taken a slow approach to any announcements around generative AI, which we see as its normal strategy,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Apple has always been a premium follower to markets, never focusing on being first but focusing on putting out superior products.”</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“We haven’t expected Apple to develop a proprietary generative AI model to license out, but focus on how to integrate generative AI into its products,” he said. “This could be small Apple-built models living on edge, or larger cloud-based models.”</p>\n<p>“A potential licensing agreement with Google Gemini would align with this — outsourcing the model itself but focusing on integrating it into products like Siri.”</p>\n<h3>Beneficial to Apple and Google</h3>\n<p>Tim Bajarin, president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativestrategies.com/\">Creative Strategies</a>, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif., pointed out that Apple has been using AI in products since they introduced the Knowledge Navigator in 1987. AI is key to both Siri and Maps, he added, and Apple has home-grown technology to deliver AI-based apps and solutions.</p>\n<p>“However, to deliver in-depth generative AI architecture on their own is expensive, and those base AI architectures are already built and can be licensed,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Even if Apple had its own Gemini-level model, it probably would not have the infrastructure to serve its massive base of customers,” he explained. “It is highly plausible that Apple could license a base generative AI architecture from another company and build even deeper and more Apple-specific products on that AI engine.”</p>\n<p>A Gemini licensing deal could be beneficial to both Apple and Google.</p>\n<p>“Licensing Gemini would enable Apple to make up considerable lost time in its own lagging AI development efforts,” said Charles King, the principal analyst at Pund-IT, a technology advisory firm in Hayward, Calif.</p>\n<p>In addition, he told TechNewsWorld, “By using a vetted third-party technology to train its AI systems, Apple will be able to preserve its well-deserved rep for honoring customers’ privacy.”</p>\n<h3>Rise of On-Device AI</h3>\n<p>“A lot of the AI models out there now require cloud access, so there’s a lot of concerns about divulging private information,” added Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Google has a flavor of Gemini — Gemini Nano — that may appeal to Apple because it can run locally,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That’s one way to preserve privacy and have the benefits of generative AI.”</p>\n<p>ABI’s Schell pointed out that Google is ahead of the pack with its Gemini family of models, which have already been deployed to run entirely on some of its Pixel phones, as well as on certain Samsung Galaxy devices. “By partnering with Google, Apple would be able to offer a relatively mature generative AI model to its customers on some or all of its devices,” he said.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“All major chipset vendors and OEMs are pivoting towards on-device generative AI as its productivity-enhancing data privacy value proposition is very convincing, and this is particularly relevant given Apple’s legacy in data privacy leadership,” he added.</p>\n<p>“As such,” he continued, “I expect a host of significant announcements around on-device generative AI at this year’s WWDC applying to Apple’s PC, tablet, and smartphone offerings.” Apple’s WWDC — World Wide Developers Conference — usually occurs in June.</p>\n<h3>Boon to Apple Users</h3>\n<p>Apple users could benefit from a Gemini licensing deal because it integrates Google’s advanced search algorithms into their ecosystem, thereby enriching search functionality, maintained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“It promotes interoperability, enabling seamless integration between Apple’s ecosystem and Google services and fostering convenience for users,” he told TechNewsWorld, “and it could potentially reduce development costs and time-to-market for Apple, as it could utilize Google’s proven technology instead of building a similar capability from scratch.”</p>\n<p>“It would obviously provide Apple with a host of capabilities it doesn’t seem to currently own, and Google would get revenue and a marquee licensing partner,” Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a news, commentary and analysis website, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>How much revenue Google — which pays Apple billions a year to be the Safari web browser’s default search engine — would get from a licensing deal is an intriguing question.</p>\n<p>“There may not be any licensing money,” Rubin suggested. “Google pays Apple for the privilege of running search on Apple’s platforms. The payment that Google gets is access to anonymized data for iPhone users, which gives them a holistic view of what people are doing on mobile. Maybe Google would be willing to offer their technology for free for the benefit of continuing to update their AI engine.”</p>\n<p>Apple and Google did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>After spending more than 25 years in the technology space — including 17 years in San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley — few things flabbergast me. But then came Thursday’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a> from the Department of Justice with its antitrust lawsuit against Apple.</p>\n<p>I’m still reeling from it. The lack of logic astounds me. The DOJ’s expansive nature of this antitrust complaint is based on archaic data — as if Ma Bell still operated as it did up to the early 1980s. If the Justice Department uses these primarily false arguments at face value, it’s hard for me to believe it can prevail against Apple.</p>\n<p>Let me opine.</p>\n<h3>Who Are the Victims?</h3>\n<p>If you look at the lawsuit from a top-level view, Apple’s biggest alleged victims are IT and banking giants. The suit clearly aims to force antitrust legislation reforms Congress hasn’t authorized. Moreover, harm to the consumer is incredibly unclear in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p>The DOJ claims Apple uses a smartphone monopoly to lock people into its closed system and undercut competitors — a credible theory that discernibly deserves inspection. Apple controls 55% of the U.S. smartphone market, giving it colossal app ecosystem power. No one doubts that.</p>\n<p>But given that the DOJ claims Apple’s monopoly stifles tech innovation, how does the DOJ explain that paid developers on the company’s app store have increased 374% to 5.2 million in the past decade? Apple released AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, and Apple Watch health features like an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and fall detector. However, numerous examples of non-Apple industry innovation have occurred over the past few years despite Apple’s closed ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>Apple Responds</h3>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Apple responded vigorously to the lawsuit and addressed much of the complaint immediately after the DOJ announced the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland remarked that Apple’s iMessage’s “restrictive nature” is responsible for the often terrible image quality of messages that frequently appear on Android smartphones when sent from an iPhone. Apparently, he’s unaware of the news or who’s accountable for the low quality of SMS/MMS between Android and iPhone users. It’s not Apple.</p>\n<p>This point also seems to ignore the fact that Apple has already publicly announced that it will embrace the RCS format to improve the messaging experience with non-iPhone users. So, where’s the damage?</p>\n<p>The DOJ seems obtuse about this consideration. Instead, it blasts messaging apps. The DOJ asserted that Apple generally makes third-party messaging apps on the iPhone worse. Relative to Apple Messages, the DOJ states that Apple’s messaging app prohibits third-party apps from sending or receiving carrier-based messages, knowingly and deliberately degrading quality, privacy, and security for its users and others who do not have iPhones.</p>\n<p>The statement is crazy and without logic. No messaging service has an Apple-limited user base, and most include iPhone apps.</p>\n<p>In most respects, it’s almost the opposite. WhatsApp dominates worldwide messaging, and its user base would be much smaller without Apple and the iPhone. Moreover, Apple isn’t responsible for poor-quality Android-to-iPhone photos and videos. SMS/MMS is a dated and primitive format that Apple has tried to correct with its Messages app.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s Ecosystem Is Terrible for Consumers</h3>\n<p>From a DOJ perspective, Apple violates section two of the Sherman Antitrust Act by restricting third-party access to hardware and software characteristics it exploits. The DOJ is concerned about digital wallets and Apple’s claimed denial of competing firms’ access to the iPhone’s NFC chip. Since its inception two years ago, companies worldwide have switched to it instead of maintaining their own hardware.</p>\n<p>According to the DOJ, there are similar issues with Apple Watch’s preferential treatment of iPhone. The suit claims rival smartwatches have limited software and hardware features.</p>\n<p>Android watches operate well with Android phones, making this assertion more challenging. Conversely, Android Watches often cannot work (partially or not at all) with iPhones. Regardless, Apple opened up GymKit so the Apple Watch’s health functions could interact with Peloton exercise equipment.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>To be clear, no law requires Apple to build apps for third-party smartwatch connections. Integrators decide. Google and Samsung, the leading integrators, declined for unknown reasons. From that standpoint, the DOJ’s language in the lawsuit looks biased and non-factual.</p>\n<p>The Apple Watch is the most popular smartwatch for reasons other than Apple depriving users of the ability to use an Android watch with an iPhone. The iPhone held half of the U.S. smartphone market in 2022 and 62% now.</p>\n<p>Apple decided not to make the Apple Watch Android-compatible, as was its prerogative. There have been multiple media reports that Apple worked for years to fix issues without compromising the product.</p>\n<p>The DOJ’s specific assertion about the smartphone business meets the legal criterion of 70% and up, implying monopoly. According to a reasonable market definition of smartphone users, nearly as many Android users can enjoy a non-Apple smartphone experience.</p>\n<h3>Consumer Choice at Risk?</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to react to a federal lawsuit that includes the language without scoffing: “To protect its smartphone monopoly — and the extraordinary profits that monopoly generates — Apple repeatedly chooses to make its products worse for consumers to prevent competition from emerging.”</p>\n<p>I suspect it would be impossible for me to round up three consumers in a 50-mile radius of my home in Silicon Valley who would assert that Apple’s ecosystem approach prevents them from considering non-Apple solutions.</p>\n<p>However, one of the DOJ’s primary Apple objections may be debatable. Apple may restrict super applications, which the DOJ describes as “providing a user with broad functionality in a single app.”</p>\n<p>Chinese super app WeChat is best known. It’s China’s most popular social media, payment, sales, and chat app. But It’s best known because it’s on the iPhone and other devices. Apple has a WeChat store instead of blocking it.</p>\n<p>Another example: Facebook/Meta’s iPhone app is great as it’s a single place for social media, payment, sales, and communications. This point confuses me as no one bans “super apps” (a term I find quite meaningless).</p>\n<h3>Legal Challenge of Proving Harm</h3>\n<p>To be sure, this antitrust madness began in the late Trump administration, not Biden’s. But it has quickly become the cornerstone of the Biden administration’s initial Big Tech promises.</p>\n<p>Now that the Pandora’s box has been opened, like all antitrust lawsuits, it will take years, and political winds may change. It may fail under Trump and may survive a second Biden term.</p>\n<p>A few Silicon Valley attorneys familiar with the matter told me that the DOJ must prove customer injury, which is difficult.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Other smartphone suppliers have raised hardware and service prices due to supply chain concerns over the last four years, so there’s no genuine justification. When Android vendors have devices costing far more, proving customer harm from a $1,500 iPhone may be a legal achievement better suited for David Copperfield than Clarence Darrow.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the DOJ must reconsider its belief that developers have a right to be unrestrained on Apple platforms. Does Costco have a right to offer its products on Walmart shelves? Can Toyota demand that its products be offered at Chrysler dealerships?</p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that corporations can choose their partners, prices, terms, and conditions. Does the DOJ recognize that?</p>\n<h3>Chilling Effect on Innovation</h3>\n<p>Indeed, the fear of DOJ investigations may have prompted Apple’s improvements or changes. Most importantly, the inquiry has made Apple a better company. However, this lawsuit has tremendous destructive potential. Discouragement of companies from making product improvements that benefit consumers will harm competitors who prefer the status quo.</p>\n<p>I’m also astonished that a few industry observers are rooting publicly for the DOJ to prevail against Apple, regardless of the actual — or lack of — case from a merits standpoint, as it could dull the company’s competitiveness. Nothing could be more dangerous should this happen if we truly believe that only the most winning and innovative solutions should prevail in any market.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the DOJ will likely appeal and waste more taxpayer money when it loses face and, most probably, in my view, the case. As countless internal emails will be disclosed due to the lawsuit, which might be embarrassing, though not illegal, Apple could take a non-trivial PR hit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the expansive nature of the lawsuit appears to be a strategic tactic by the DOJ to force Apple to accept some type of settlement, which the company will not do.</p>\n<h3>Not Perfect, Not Illegal</h3>\n<p>Apple is not perfect, and angels do not adorn the company’s executive ranks. The company makes some product decisions — mainly from an end-user upgrade standpoint — that annoy me and force me to pay higher prices. I also don’t like that I can’t access my iMessages on a Windows PC in a robust manner.</p>\n<p>However, these are not monopolistic actions, and I can’t fault Apple. I might do the same if I were making those decisions to optimize the power of its ecosystem and product margins.</p>\n<p>Yes, Apple is enormously successful, but it has stumbled. Its efforts in electric and automated vehicles failed famously, and it lags in AI. Artificial intelligence’s rapid and unpredictable growth may upend IT businesses and markets. If Apple has actively participated in premeditated and nefarious anti-competitive actions that have harmed the consumer, the DOJ will need to produce stronger evidence than what we’ve seen thus far.</p>\n<p>By the end of this suit, Apple’s dominance may look as outdated as IBM’s did after the company dominated the PC business during the 1980s and 1990s, only to jettison it to Lenovo in 2005.</p>\n<p>The DOJ would be well advised to remember those lessons.</p>\n",

This discussion explores whether MediaTek is experiencing such a crisis and, if so, what the implications might be.</p>\n<h3>MediaTek’s History</h3>\n<p>Founded 27 years ago and headquartered in Taiwan, MediaTek initially focused on producing chips for home entertainment products and optical storage solutions. Over time, the company expanded into the mobile phone market, a shift that significantly increased its global footprint and prominence.</p>\n<p>MediaTek has predominantly focused its strategy on offering cost-effective solutions for mid-range and budget devices, which helped it gain substantial market share in emerging markets across Asia and Africa.</p>\n<p>In contrast, competitors like Qualcomm have traditionally dominated the high-end smartphone market, particularly in Western countries. This divergence in market focus is crucial to understanding MediaTek’s brand identity, which the public often views as a more affordable, less performance-oriented alternative to Qualcomm.</p>\n<h3>Alleged Identity Crisis</h3>\n<p>The notion of MediaTek experiencing an identity crisis stems from several factors. Recently, the company has made significant efforts to challenge Qualcomm in the high-end smartphone market, notably with its Dimensity sub-brand, which offers competitive performance and features like 5G connectivity.</p>\n<p>This move has indeed expanded MediaTek’s global market share. The company maintains more than 40% of the Android market in North America and Europe and a 40%- 50% TAM (total addressable market) share of the Latin America and Pacific Rim markets.</p>\n<p>The company also points out that it has more than 30% TAM share in the ruthlessly competitive market in China. MediaTek could not realize accomplishments like this with purely lower-cost, lower-performance solutions.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Nonetheless, MediaTek suffers from public perception and branding challenges. The company has historically been less vocal about its achievements and innovations than Qualcomm, which has a robust marketing strategy that includes significant advertising spending and collaborations with high-profile brands and carriers. This relative silence has contributed to MediaTek’s weaker, or at least more ambiguous, brand identity.</p>\n<p>Despite significant advancements, competitive products, and technological innovations that should enhance its industry stature, MediaTek has sometimes struggled to shake off its image as a budget chipset manufacturer. This reputation affects its ability to compete in the premium chipmaker segment, where branding and consumer perception play crucial roles.</p>\n<p>There’s also the issue of geographical market dynamics. MediaTek’s stronger presence in emerging markets than established ones like the U.S. and Europe has further complicated its identity. Although it is a leader in several regions, the company has not gotten the respect it deserves.</p>\n<h3>How MediaTek Is Trying To Course-Correct</h3>\n<p>To address its identity issues, MediaTek hasn’t stood still and has been making several strategic moves. The company has increased investment in its marketing and branding initiatives to elevate its brand perception globally. For example, MediaTek’s “Incredible Inside” campaign is a worthy effort to associate MediaTek-powered devices with high quality and innovation.</p>\n<p>Going one step further, MediaTek is collaborating with renowned brands and companies that can help the company enhance its reputation. In addition, partnerships, such as those with Intel for 5G laptop modems, have helped position MediaTek as an innovative and versatile chipmaker.</p>\n<p>The company has also realized that focusing on cutting-edge technology is the only way to upgrade its brand image. Markets like IoT, automotive, data centers, Chromebooks, smart TVs — and even the smartphone space, which remains a huge market from a volume standpoint despite its slow growth — demand differentiating solutions, particularly AI capabilities that create new and compelling usage models.</p>\n<p>These actions could help redefine MediaTek’s brand as a leading innovator across various tech sectors, not just mobile phones.</p>\n<h3>AI a Key Factor in MediaTek’s Future Growth</h3>\n<p>Last week in Arizona, MediaTek briefed the analyst community at an event that focused on the company’s ongoing efforts to fine-tune its appeal in multiple end markets to allow it to optimize its presence in the mobile, smart edge, and power IC markets that have respective CAGR growth of 5.3%, 6.8% and 6.3% in a TAM that MediaTek believes will be approximately $180 billion by 2028.</p>\n<p>At the conference, MediaTek dedicated considerable attention to the untapped potential that generative AI will drive over the next ten years. The company sees gen AI as the impetus for meaningful growth across its portfolio of products — which translates to more semiconductor content per device.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Moreover, MediaTek believes it has the technology attributes to bring gen AI to the edge and push innovation in a differentiated manner to its customers.</p>\n<p>While these megatrends imply a bright future for MediaTek, the company must dedicate more marketing resources to message its view on compelling usage models.</p>\n<h3>MediaTek’s Platform Solutions</h3>\n<p>With seven distinct major sub-brands that span the gamut from smartphones, automotive, Wi-Fi, Chromebooks, smart TVs, IoT, and even industrial applications, MediaTek must expand its marketing spend to compete with the likes of Qualcomm and others who have made branding and go-to-market initiatives a priority.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/MediaTek-platforms.jpg\" alt=\"MediaTek platforms\" width=\"1000\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/MediaTek-platforms.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/MediaTek-platforms-300x81.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/MediaTek-platforms-768x207.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>(Image courtesy of MediaTek)</p>\n<p>While MediaTek does face challenges in terms of market perception and branding, particularly as it attempts to transition into higher-end markets, labeling these challenges as an “identity crisis” might be an overstatement. Instead, MediaTek is in a phase of identity evolution, both necessary and inevitable, as it seeks to diversify its offerings and compete globally across different segments.</p>\n<h3>MediaTek Must Assert Its Thought Leadership Marketing Potential</h3>\n<p>The company’s ability to navigate this evolution successfully will depend on its strategic marketing, partnerships, and technological innovation choices. As MediaTek redefines itself, it may overcome the perception hurdles and emerge more potent, with a more distinct and respected identity within the global semiconductor industry.</p>\n<p>For MediaTek to position itself as a thought leader in AI, it must confidently articulate usage models at a highly detailed level. While the company has strong executive leadership and has demonstrated impressive business results, there is noticeable hesitation at analyst events to present detailed applications. This reluctance may stem from a concern that these models might not fully align with its customers’ perspectives.</p>\n<p>Embracing a role as a thought leader involves guiding the industry with innovative ideas and frameworks, even if they initially diverge from customer expectations. OEMs will respect MediaTek’s input on these usage models, even if they choose to implement them differently. By defining clear, visionary strategies, MediaTek can build and enhance its brand leadership persona and drive the adoption of its solutions, fostering alignment over time.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, this kind of messaging leadership involves risk. In the final analysis, MediaTek must proactively increase its marketing investment and refine its messaging on usage models to assert control over its market perception, differentiate its offerings, and clearly communicate the unique benefits of its solutions so that it remains competitive and, most importantly, relevant in the rapidly evolving tech industry.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>“Apple Intelligence,” the company’s answer to the likes of Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot, didn’t exhibit many tricks not already seen on those other platforms, but it did excel in two areas: integration and privacy.</p>\n<p>The technology, announced in a prerecorded presentation Monday at Apple’s annual World Wide Developers Conference, largely taps into a user’s personal information to perform its AI functions and does much of it on the devices where the data is stored to ensure privacy.</p>\n<p>“There are already some really impressive chat tools out there that perform a vast array of tasks using world knowledge, but these tools know very little about you or your needs,” Apple Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said in the presentation. “With iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, we are embarking on a new journey to bring you intelligence that understands you.”</p>\n<p>He noted that Apple Intelligence can be used to understand and create language, as well as images, and take action to simplify interactions across devices and apps. It can do things like prioritize notifications and provide writing tools to rewrite, summarize, and proofread text.</p>\n<p>“They’re deeply integrating AI into your personal data and enhancing that data using artificial intelligence to make your apps smarter, integrate features, and expand capabilities,” explained Tim Bajarin, president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativestrategies.com/\">Creative Strategies</a>, a technology advisory firm, in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“It’s a unique approach,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Apple is the only one who can do it because they control the hardware, software and semiconductors in their system.”</p>\n<h3>A Personal Kind of AI</h3>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, added that Apple’s vision of Apple Intelligence is based on personalized experience.</p>\n<p>“People have been focusing on ChatGPT and other AI applications for publicly available content,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Apple’s view is that the real value of Apple Intelligence is how users will use it in a very personalized and customized way.”</p>\n<p>“Apple Intelligence will offer a number of interesting applications that the average person will be able to leverage and see the value of,” he said.</p>\n<p>“They’ve thrown the gauntlet down,” he declared. “They’re saying that if you really want to drive AI for the common person, it has to be personalized, it has to be customizable, it has to have meaningful applications, and it has to have a privacy component built into it.”</p>\n<h3>Private Cloud Compute</h3>\n<p>The cornerstone of Apple’s personal intelligence system is on-device processing, Federighi explained. It allows Apple Intelligence to be aware of personal data without collecting it.</p>\n<p>Not all processing can be performed locally, however. Some tasks may need to be performed in the cloud. For those tasks, Apple has created “Private Cloud Compute,” which allows Apple devices to connect to specialized servers running on Apple silicon for enhanced processing.</p>\n<p>“These Apple silicon servers offer the privacy and security of your iPhone from the silicon on up, draw on the security properties of the Swift programming language, and run software with transparency built in,” Federighi elaborated.</p>\n<p>“When you make a request, Apple Intelligence analyzes whether it can be processed on device,” he continued. “If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on Private Cloud Compute and send only the data that’s relevant to your task to be processed on Apple silicon servers. Your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple.”</p>\n<p>“And, just like your iPhone, independent experts can inspect the code that runs on these servers to verify this privacy promise,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“If Private Cloud Compute is true to its word, it’s a nice effort and one that differentiates Apple pretty well,” Eric Abbruzzese, a research director at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abiresearch.com/\">ABI Research</a>, a technology advisory company headquartered in Oyster Bay, N.Y., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Vena was impressed with Apple’s care in building the privacy foundation for Apple Intelligence during the presentation. “If you look at all the usage models that they demonstrated, they have to have access to emails and text messages, so it was important to convince people that privacy is at the core of the way they’re approaching AI,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, not all AI requests go to Apple servers. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is also in the mix. Siri might determine that a query might be best answered by ChatGPT rather than personal sources. In that case, Siri would ask permission to send the query to the OpenAI chatbot.</p>\n<p>“Apple got OpenAI to agree to not log users’ requests, and no personal data can be given to ChatGPT unless you give it permission,” Bajarin explained. “It’s a great approach and extremely secure.”</p>\n<h3>AI on Apple’s Terms</h3>\n<p>Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, noted that Apple Intelligence offers the company an opportunity to leverage the power of its processors to do something besides rendering video or playing a game faster.</p>\n<p>“It allows them to bring more of these AI models onto the device, which helps their privacy stance,” he told TechNewsWorld. “While Apple Intelligence is interacting with a lot of personal information, none of that information is going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>“This is AI on Apple’s terms,” he said.</p>\n<p>“No one is going to say we’ve never seen AI do this before,” he added. “It’s the way they’ve integrated it into their apps that represents a more comprehensive approach that we’ve seen thus far.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Anshel Sag, a senior analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas, agreed.</p>\n<p>“They’re not doing anything particularly novel, but their integration at the platform level is good and compelling,” he told TechNewsWorld. “And they’re telling a strong privacy and computer story, which is in line with everything expected from Apple.”</p>\n<p>“What they announced is similar to what we’re seeing from other companies, just not at this scale,” he said. “What you’re seeing with Apple Intelligence is a tighter, cleaner integration of what everyone else has already done with a slight Apple twist to it. It’s not particularly groundbreaking.”</p>\n<h3>More Than Just a Value-Add</h3>\n<p>Abbruzzese noted that Apple has approached AI as it has approached other products.</p>\n<p>“They’re never first to market. They try to be the best,” he said. “It’s too early to know if they’re the best, but I was struck by how cohesive the announcement was. Everything fit together nicely.”</p>\n<p>“I haven’t felt the same way for other players,” he continued. “AI always felt like a value-add to something else. It was not as well-integrated.”</p>\n<p>“Every AI feature Apple announced works across the ecosystem,” he added. “We haven’t seen as broad-reaching synergy as that before. Microsoft Copilot is powerful, but it doesn’t feel as well integrated into the Windows ecosystem as Apple Intelligence.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Today is April Fools’ Day, but this is no laughing matter. The U.S. is dealing with one of the most expensive accidents in its history. On March 26, a container ship lost power several times and hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge with two pilots on board. Lives were lost, and it’s estimated to take $400 million and possibly a decade to rebuild.</p>\n<p>I’ve had a lot of experience on the water. I taught myself to sail at age 12, worked on the harbor patrol as both enforcement and fire and trained to race 17-meter boats. The largest boat I’ve helmed was a 450-foot freighter to Micronesia (I wasn’t good at it).</p>\n<p>We could have avoided last week’s disaster if the port had been properly automated and run by AI. Let’s walk through how we might use AI to prevent this kind of disaster, why AI is potentially much safer for ports of all types, and why it is critical we begin to use AI tools more aggressively to have a better chance of preventing this kind of catastrophic outcome.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, the HP Elite mt645 G8, a new thin client laptop from HP that could dramatically reduce support aggravation and improve security in companies and schools.</p>\n<h3>My Fantome Schooner Story</h3>\n<p>The Key Bridge disaster reminds me of when I was sailing on a much smaller 679-ton <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantome_(schooner)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fantome schooner</a>. The captain of that ship told the following story.</p>\n<p>They had moored the schooner next to a larger Norwegian Cruise Lines ship. The Fantome’s captain used to be a captain for NCL, so he wanted to show off leaving port. He ordered the sails unfurled, only to see that instead of turning like it was supposed to, the Fantome was aimed right at the Norwegian ship.</p>\n<p>The Fantome was an ex-warship, so it had not only a solid steel bowsprit but also a bow that was protected by about three inches of battleship steel since it was designed to be able to ram. The Norwegian ship, in contrast, had about .25 inches of lighter steel protecting it amidships. The problem was that the third mate, who was supposed to have raised the foresails, which would push the boat around, was instead flirting with passengers.</p>\n<p>The captain had a choice: fire up the huge engines and order full astern, which would likely just punch a hole the size of a house in the side of the cruise ship, or order full ahead and hope there was enough steerage to bring the ship around far enough to miss entirely.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Of course, if the ship didn’t come around, he’d likely sink both ships. He ordered full ahead but still hit the cruise ship with a glancing blow, scraping down the side and snapping the square-rigged top mast (as thick as I was tall and solid oak) in half.</p>\n<p>Sadly, he died at sea when the Fantome sank a few months later in a massive storm — but avoiding an “almost” unavoidable accident is what an experienced skipper is capable of and well within the capability of a well-trained AI.</p>\n<p>My point is that most captains aren’t big risk-takers, rarely have to deal with catastrophes, aren’t regularly trained or certified on simulators, and are generally unprepared for problems like the bridge collision or my Fantome story.</p>\n<p>However, exceptional captains learn from their peers, expect problems, and execute a variety of drills to help assure positive outcomes. AI can make every captain a great captain if properly trained and implemented, and it can act at machine speeds far faster than humans.</p>\n<h3>Using AI To Prevent Another Bridge Catastrophe</h3>\n<p>While we will likely spend much of the post-collision effort looking for people to blame, in my world, the work should initially be to both understand the problem and immediately move to prevent its recurrence.</p>\n<p>The issue appears to be that the cause of the problem wasn’t identified in a timely manner, the crew wasn’t trained on what to do when there is a catastrophic power failure in close quarters (though the two pilots evidently were), and notifications for help went out far later than they should have, which prevented most mitigation efforts other than blocking the bridge and calling for tugs — which were done — from being effective.</p>\n<p>Modern ships have extensive sensors that report to the bridge. However, this data generally isn’t conveyed in real time to anyone who isn’t on board the vessel, unlike commercial aircraft, which also report in real time to a number of remote monitoring stations. A typical port authority generally lacks the staffing level required for effective remote monitoring, even if they were to receive this data. So, simply requiring the data flow to the port authority probably would not have changed the outcome.</p>\n<p>This is where AI, or in this case multiple AIs, would come in.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Had the bridge crew had access to a well-trained AI, that AI would have, depending on the implementation, modeled what was likely to happen, estimated the damage and liability for each of many potential outcomes, and then recommended or executed the plan with the best potential for reducing damage and saving lives — by likely immediately dropping the anchors and ordering engine restart and full astern.</p>\n<p>Further, it probably would have begun alerting and mitigation efforts as soon as the engines started to behave badly and well before engine failure.</p>\n<p>The Port Authority’s AI would have, through remote monitoring, identified the same problem and responded immediately by ordering the bridge closed and evacuated for safety, alerting tugs (which could be robotic) to immediately deploy and halt and hold the container ship, and spun up both fire and patrol resources to deploy and stand by as needed.</p>\n<p>Granted, much of this would have also required integrated communications, which evidently were not in place since, as of this writing, it appears no one notified the bridge crew before the collapse.</p>\n<p>Such measures would have added layers of protection for the bridge, helped ensure that no lives were lost, and prevented a catastrophe that will likely cost billions, making the cost of training and deploying the AI in both the ship and the Port Authority trivial by comparison.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Just as importantly, the artificial intelligence systems could share all their actions and lessons learned from the accident with other ships and ports, further reducing the risk of similar incidents. This approach starkly contrasts with the current situation, where the knowledge gained from this disaster might never reach crews that do not visit this particular port.</p>\n<p>For perspective, a new container ship typically costs between $50 million and $200 million. The cost to create a custom generative AI is about $100 million and is justifiable if it prevented just one accident like the Key Bridge. Once trained, this same AI could be used on multiple ships with relatively little modification. This one accident will likely incur liability in the $1 billion-plus range, supporting the argument that it is worth the money to use AI to ensure this kind of thing never happens again.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>AI has been developed to drive vehicles of all sizes autonomously. IBM has been testing AI automation on ships for some time, and core to its implementation is a concept Toyota once called Guardian Angel.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>This feature is designed to step in during a crisis and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and the vehicle using the equivalent of centuries of driver/navigator training provided through tools like Nvidia’s Omniverse. For a catastrophe like this, that extra edge, acting either autonomously or through command staff, could and will make the difference between a close-miss story like the Fantome and the tragic bridge collapse.</p>\n<p>The ability of AI to intervene effectively in emergencies, utilizing simulated training to protect people and vehicles, underscores the necessity for its broader deployment. No one is prepared for every critical problem, but artificial intelligence can come far closer than any human, and we all could use an actual Guardian Angel.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>HP Elite mt645 G8 Mobile Thin Client</h3>\n<p>I started working in tech about the same time the IBM PC came to market. While working for IBM, I had the horrible experience of being temporarily moved from a PC to a terminal. To say I hated that move would be a massive understatement.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, terminals had several advantages. They didn’t run code, so catching viruses was not a concern, and their appliance-like nature meant that after warming up (they used old tube TV-like CRT displays), they never seemed to break. Although I never figured out why I needed a color monitor or a light pen.</p>\n<p>However, PCs provided far more flexibility and freedom, so we traded the security, reliability, and ease of use of terminals for the much harder-to-use PCs that gave us more freedom. Since that pivot, the industry has been trying to regain the benefits of the terminal while still retaining the freedom of a PC. The closest thing it came up with was the “thin client,” which is basically a PC that ran everything initially from a hosted service and now mainly from the cloud.</p>\n<p>The historical issue with thin clients is that they tended to look cheap; they were slow with significant latency (you seemed to be always waiting for them), and they needed a wired connection to work, meaning they couldn’t be mobile.</p>\n<p>However, with the advent of 4G and modern Wi-Fi, the latency and slowness issues have been corrected, and the user experience is now close to what it would be on a stand-alone PC. But they still were embarrassingly cheap looking, and users given one thought they were being punished.</p>\n<p>Well, the HP Elite mt645 G8 not only runs Windows IoT or Linux (ThinPro), but it looks just like any other premium professional HP laptop. It has Wolf Security, including Wolf’s unique security chip, and is configurable with a 1,000-nit Sure View display for secure outside work.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/HP-Elite-mt645-G8.jpg\" alt=\"HP Elite mt645 G8 Mobile Thin Client\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/HP-Elite-mt645-G8.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/HP-Elite-mt645-G8-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/HP-Elite-mt645-G8-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The HP Elite mt645 G8 mobile thin client laptop (Image Credit: HP)</p>\n<p>This mobile thin client device has Wi-Fi 6e compatibility and a 4G option (I expect 5G is coming), Ryzen graphics, a 5MP camera, a software stack optimized for virtualization and Office 365, and, while it initially uses Windows IoT 10, it will have the option to move to Windows IoT 11 shortly.</p>\n<p>It makes relatively heavy use of recycled and recyclable materials and carries an EPEAT Gold certification for sustainability.

      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://proton.me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Proton</a>, the maker of an email system known for its strong security, has added passkey support for its password manager while knocking “Big Tech” for trapping their users’ passkeys behind “walled gardens.”</p>\n<p>“Even though passkeys were developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium to replace passwords and are meant to provide ‘faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices,’ their rollout hasn’t lived up to these lofty ideals,” Son Nguyen, founder of SimpleLogin and a developer of Proton Pass, wrote in a blog Monday.</p>\n<p>“Instead, the first organizations to offer passkeys, Apple and Google, prioritized using the technology to lock people into their walled gardens rather than provide a secure solution to everyone,” he continued. “This closed approach diminishes the value of passkeys for everyone and makes it less likely that they’ll be universally adopted, which is critical if they’re to ever replace passwords.”</p>\n<p>Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla., agreed with Nguyen. “The original and current existing FIDO passkey standard and the way the big vendors, such as Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/google-takes-giant-step-toward-passwordless-world-with-new-passkey-setting-178697.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google</a>, and Apple implement it, create walled gardens,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“FIDO is aware of this problem and is currently working on an updated version of passkeys that removes this limitation,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Proton isn’t the first company to tackle the problem of passkey platform lock,” he added. “For instance, the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> password manager allows you to use passkeys across platforms.”</p>\n<h3>No Vendor Lock-In</h3>\n<p>However, the FIDO Alliance disagreed with Proton’s assertions. “Passkeys were never created to be only the domain of Big Tech,” said Executive Director and CEO Andrew Shikiar.</p>\n<p>“We’ve always contemplated an open ecosystem around this, which is why you see companies like 1Password, Dashlane, and other credential managers taking part in the FIDO Alliance,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“There’s no vendor lock-in,” he said. “In fact, all these companies are actively working in the FIDO Alliance to look at a new protocol to allow for credential portability. They’re all working on allowing you to migrate passkeys from one cloud to another.”</p>\n<p>“Passkeys are designed to be implemented with all types of platforms, apps, and operating systems,” added James E. Lee, chief operating officer of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idtheftcenter.org/\">Identity Theft Resource Center</a>, a nonprofit organization in San Diego devoted to minimizing risk and mitigating the impact of identity compromise and crime.</p>\n<p>“That’s exactly what we are seeing now,” he told TechNewsWorld. “To do otherwise would even further delay the adoption of what is an exponentially more secure process.”</p>\n<h3>Clunky User Experiences</h3>\n<p>Nguyen maintained that after seeing Big Tech’s rollout of passkeys, several password managers also rushed their <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-realities-of-switching-to-a-passwordless-computing-future-178579.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">release of passkeys</a>, resulting in a clunky user experience.</p>\n<p>“Some password managers only support passkeys via their web extension, making it difficult for anyone trying to log in to the same app with a passkey on their mobile phone,” he wrote. “Most password managers that support passkeys only offer them with a paid plan, meaning Google Password Manager and Apple Keychain were the only viable free passkey providers until Proton Pass added them.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Big Tech was among the first to begin building solutions for a passwordless world, but a walled-gardens approach limits the adoption potential of passkeys among consumers,” added Anna Pobletts, head of passwordless at 1Password.</p>\n<p>“At 1Password,” she told TechNewsWorld, “we’ve taken an interoperable approach so that users can navigate the transition from passwords to passwordless and to ensure they have a choice in how they manage their online identities across platforms and devices — both at work and at home.”</p>\n<h3>Phishing-Resistant Solution</h3>\n<p>Darren Guccione, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company in Chicago, noted that traditional password-based systems are plagued by inherent vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/researchers-instantly-crack-simple-passwords-with-ai-178233.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brute-force attacks</a>, phishing, and human-factor weaknesses.</p>\n<p>“Passwordless authentication methods that leverage biometrics, multi-factor authentication, and advanced technologies offer a robust defense against these threats,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>In contrast to passwords, which typically consist of a combination of characters, numbers, and symbols, passkeys rely on the principles of public-key cryptography, he explained. They utilize a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key securely stored on the user’s device and a public key registered with the service provider.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, passkeys employ a challenge-response mechanism, he continued.</p>\n<p>When a user attempts to access their account, the service provider dispatches a challenge to the user’s device. Subsequently, the device signs the challenge with the private key and transmits the signed response back to the server for validation.</p>\n<p>Because the private key never leaves the user’s device and isn’t transmitted over the network, passkeys provide a heightened level of security compared to traditional passwords and are phishing-resistant.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Passkeys are limited to the device on which they are created unless you create and save the passkey in a password manager,” Guccione said. “Storing passkeys in a secure password manager provides access to your passkeys, no matter what device you’re using or where you’re logging in from, allowing you to use them across different browsers and operating systems.”</p>\n<p>“Passkeys eliminate some of the most common social engineering attacks, like phishing or credential stuffing, altogether, as they remove the reward that hackers are after — credentials,” added Pobletts.</p>\n<h3>Not Supplanting Passwords</h3>\n<p>Guccione noted that the future of passkeys appears promising but cautiously so and marked by gradual advancement. “The robust backing from tech leaders such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon is a step in the right direction,” he said. “Standardization endeavors may play a pivotal role in overcoming interoperability challenges and fostering more widespread adoption.”</p>\n<p>“Nonetheless,” he added, “it’s vital to acknowledge that passkeys will not supplant passwords in the near future, if ever.”</p>\n<p>“Among the billions of websites in existence, only a fraction of a percent currently offer support for passkeys,” he continued. “This extremely limited adoption can be attributed to various factors, including the level of support from underlying platforms, the need for website adjustments, and the requirement for user-initiated configuration.”</p>\n<p>To be a true account security solution, passkeys must become universal, Nguyen added.</p>\n<p>“Like many online features, passkeys benefit from a network effect,” he wrote. “The more sites and services that use passkeys, the better and easier a solution they are for users (with the added benefit of making everyone’s data more secure). Unfortunately, Big Tech has treated passkeys as an opportunity to advance their commercial interests rather than as a tool to provide universal security.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>While Marc Andreessen and I disagree on what happened when Netscape went under, my perception was that Netscape blew its considerable lead on Microsoft in browsers by not adequately protecting it and not realizing the power of Microsoft marketing back then.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s marketing capabilities have declined sharply since then. While it blindsided Google with Copilot on search, Microsoft failed to market the advantage successfully or advance it significantly enough to avoid a huge pushback from Google. That pushback happened last week at Google I/O, and it was an impressive showing.</p>\n<p>Another weakness for Microsoft is that Google has focused on smartphones as the vehicle for its AI efforts, while Microsoft has focused on PCs. Google’s path is probably the better one. As we move from text to voice interface and include ever more capabilities for the AI to see, it makes more sense to have it in a tool that is always with you rather than just on your desk or in your laptop bag.</p>\n<p>Much like Microsoft’s was with Netscape, I think Google’s approach hits harder where people want AI to be. Microsoft Build is this week. I’m not expecting a smartphone push, but you never know. Microsoft doesn’t go down easy. So, calling the winner will have to wait until next week, at least.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you want to see something that is both fascinating and just a bit freaky, watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MirzFk_DSiI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> of two OpenAI GPT-4o phones having a chat with each other (thankfully, neither argued for taking over the world). When I finished watching this, I felt redundant.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk Google I/O this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, a great new AI PC laptop from Lenovo that is an impressive example of its class.</p>\n<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>AI is changing incredibly rapidly. Today, most people access AI either through an application like Grammarly or from the cloud through a browser interface. That’s a problem if you want to use the same AI interface while away from your desk. The vendors believe, and I agree, that you’ll prefer AI to be with you wherever you go, not just wait for you back at the office.</p>\n<p>In addition, much like we changed the desktop hardware significantly when we went from mainframes and command line interfaces to graphical user interfaces, mice, and PCs, so, too, do I expect we’ll change our endpoints when we move from the PC interfaces and accessories to an AI interface that is more like another human than like how we’ve worked with PCs in the past.</p>\n<p>This change suggests that even smartphones may be at risk, but they are closer to where we’ll end up than the PC is at this point. The <a href=\"https://humane.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Humane Ai Pin</a> is an attempt, for instance, to find what that future device would look like — and, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">early smartphones</a>, it isn’t very close to what people want yet, but it is evolving much like smartphones did. So, I wouldn’t write Humane out just yet.</p>\n<h3>Qualcomm’s Role in the AI Market</h3>\n<p>This positioning puts Qualcomm in a really interesting spot because not only is it the leading provider of smartphone AI technology, but its Snapdragon X also currently leads the market in PC AI technology. It’s rumored that Qualcomm will be taking center stage at Microsoft Build this week.</p>\n<p>So, of all the high-end chip vendors, Qualcomm is the best positioned on both platforms to drive the client side of AI development. At the same time, Nvidia remains the most powerful technology provider in the server, high-performance computing, supercomputer, and workstation segments.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm and Nvidia have never gotten along very well, but if they ever hooked up, they could own the entire AI wave. This speculation might add another interesting dynamic to the mix, given AMD and Intel are ramping up AI efforts impressively.</p>\n<p>Right now, both Google and Qualcomm have a significant advantage in the AI race. However, the race is very early, and I expect leadership to shift a lot. It might eventually go to some vendor like OpenAI, even though Microsoft just announced an impressive internal AI effort similar to what it did with Spyglass in the browser wars. So, it could flip the script this week at Build. That show will be worth attending.</p>\n<h3>Google I/O 2024 Announcements</h3>\n<p>With Qualcomm and Nvidia pushing the boundaries in AI hardware, it’s crucial to keep an eye on how software developments complement these advancements. This brings us to the recent announcements from Google I/O, where several exciting new projects were unveiled.</p>\n<h4>Project Astra</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/project-astra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Astra</a> has to be one of the coolest things I’ve seen so far. Your smartphone becomes another set of eyes that connect you to the power of AI to answer questions. These questions could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is this actor on the TV screen?</li>\n<li>How do I assemble this device or toy?</li>\n<li>Where did I leave my glasses? (Though it can’t see if they are on your head — yet.)</li>\n<li>What is the code I’m looking at trying to do?</li>\n<li>Where can I buy what that person is wearing?</li>\n<li>What’s the name of the movie in this Facebook video, and what kind of car is that?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Project Astra is a genuine assistant, and its capabilities will expand as it learns about more and more things. Since I’m a guy, and guys tend to toss out instructions, it will be a godsend for me for those times I’ve tossed the instructions and really shouldn’t have.</p>\n<h4>Gemini Nano</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/nano/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gemini Nano</a> is Google’s client-side implementation of Gemini and is in line with what Microsoft will be showcasing at Build. This feature will allow your Android smartphone to recognize images, sounds, and spoken languages you don’t speak in real time. You can do voice searches for videos and pictures on your device, and you can film a problem you are having, and it will, assuming it knows, provide suggestions on how to fix it.</p>\n<h4>New AR Glasses</h4>\n<p>Remember Google Glass and that it sucked a lot? Well, Google showcased a new pair of AR glasses in prototype form, suggesting it will make another run at this. They are wireless and can give you answers for what you are looking at when tied to Project Astra.</p>\n<p>This capability supports the idea of a vastly different computing device than a smartphone, given that those who wear the glasses interact with the microphone and speakers in those glasses, not in the smartphone. They looked a ton better than Google Glass, but that is a pretty low bar.</p>\n<h4>Scam Detection</h4>\n<p>While I’m a little nervous about having anything listen to my calls, the increase in telephone fraud has me worried, particularly as bad actors spin up AI models to do that fraud. This Gemini-based tool listens in on your calls, warns you if it looks like you are being scammed, and recommends you disconnect from the call immediately.</p>\n<p>This feature would have helped the older woman in the movie “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuBT2sNmBMU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BeeKeeper</a>” significantly, but then the movie would have been far shorter. Thousands of people are scammed like she was every year, and this technology, while not the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIZGe8sJP4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remedy</a> the BeeKeeper used (which I’d prefer), it should significantly increase security around folks in every age group.</p>\n<h4>AI Android</h4>\n<p>Interestingly, Google’s use of AI on Android reminds me a lot of Windows 95 in terms of how the interface is integrated, and Microsoft’s use of AI, so far, reminds me more of Windows + DOS in that it is more of an overlay.</p>\n<p>I think this will force Microsoft to release Windows 12 earlier and, I hope, to fix its marketing problem because the numbers I’ve recently seen suggest a lot of people are going back to Windows 10 from Windows 11, putting Microsoft in a pickle in terms of driving the next upgrade, which reminds me again of some of the execution issues Netscape had with Navigator.</p>\n<h4>AI Teammate</h4>\n<p>We’ve already had the release of <a href=\"https://www.cognition.ai/introducing-devin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devin</a>, the first AI software engineer from Cognition, but what Google announced was far more generic and likely a ton cheaper to buy.</p>\n<p>AI Teammate is an artificial intelligence co-worker that is like an executive secretary. It does what Microsoft promised some time ago but never really delivered with Cortana. Built on Workspace, Google called its AI “Chip” (I liked Cortana better), and it should be a massive help in meetings. I’m just hoping they’ll do what Microsoft didn’t and create a device like this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggE3VI3NRg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Holographic Cortana Appliance</a>.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Google I/O was amazing this year, and we’ll see how Microsoft responds this week. But this really points to the problem Microsoft has by not sticking with the Windows phone. I think this also showcases that Microsoft — even though it hit first like Netscape did — is a day late and a dollar short. The pivot will be more powerful on smartphones than it will be on PCs, which will be massively disruptive to those firms that don’t have both platforms.</p>\n<p>In the end, this year’s event went down as the most important, informative, and interesting Google I/O so far, but we are still at the very start of the AI wave. I’m still a bit worried we are focusing on speed over quality. By the end of 2025, we should know whether Google is the new Microsoft and if Microsoft becomes the new Netscape.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Lenovo ThinkBook 13x G4 AI-Ready Laptop</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Lenovo-ThinkBook-13x-2up.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo ThinkBook 13x G4 laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Lenovo-ThinkBook-13x-2up.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Lenovo-ThinkBook-13x-2up-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Lenovo-ThinkBook-13x-2up-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>(Image Credit: Lenovo)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-x/lenovo-thinkbook-13x-gen-4-(13-inch-intel)/len101b0036\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lenovo ThinkBook 13X G4</a> is an outstanding notebook, and it’s certainly one of the best-looking laptops I’ve tested so far.

      "content": "<p>Nvidia is pumping up the power in its line of artificial intelligence chips with the announcement Monday of its Blackwell GPU architecture at its first in-person GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in five years.</p>\n<p>According to Nvidia, the chip, designed for use in large data centers — the kind that power the likes of AWS, Azure, and Google — offers 20 PetaFLOPS of AI performance which is 4x faster on AI-training workloads, 30x faster on AI-inferencing workloads and up to 25x more power efficient than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>Compared to its predecessor, the H100 “Hopper,” the B200 Blackwell is both more powerful and energy efficient, Nvidia maintained. To train an AI model the size of GPT-4, for example, would take 8,000 H100 chips and 15 megawatts of power. That same task would take only 2,000 B200 chips and four megawatts of power.</p>\n<p>“This is the company’s first big advance in chip design since the debut of the Hopper architecture two years ago,” Bob O’Donnell, founder and chief analyst of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.technalysisresearch.com/\">Technalysis Research</a>, wrote in his weekly LinkedIn newsletter.</p>\n<h3>Repackaging Exercise</h3>\n<p>However, Sebastien Jean, CTO of <a href=\"https://www.phison.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Phison Electronics</a>, a Taiwanese electronics company, called the chip “a repackaging exercise.”</p>\n<p>“It’s good, but it’s not groundbreaking,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It will run faster, use less power, and allow more compute into a smaller area, but from a technologist perspective, they just squished it smaller without really changing anything fundamental.”</p>\n<p>“That means that their results are easily replicated by their competitors,” he said. “Though there is value in being first because while your competition catches up, you move on to the next thing.”</p>\n<p>“When you force your competition into a permanent catch-up game, unless they have very strong leadership, they will fall into a ‘fast follower’ mentality without realizing it,” he said.</p>\n<p>“By being aggressive and being first,” he continued, “Nvidia can cement the idea that they are the only true innovators, which drives further demand for their products.”</p>\n<p>Although Blackwell may be a repackaging exercise, he added, it has a real net benefit. “In practical terms, people using Blackwell will be able to do more compute faster for the same power and space budget,” he noted. “That will allow solutions based on Blackwell to outpace and outperform their competition.”</p>\n<h3>Plug-Compatible With Past</h3>\n<p>O’Donnell asserted that the Blackwell architecture’s second-generation transformer engine is a significant advancement because it reduces AI floating point calculations to four bits from eight bits. “Practically speaking, by reducing these calculations down from 8-bit on previous generations, they can double the compute performance and model sizes they can support on Blackwell with this single change,” he said.</p>\n<p>The new chips are also compatible with their predecessors. “If you already have Nvidia’s systems with the H100, Blackwell is plug-compatible,” observed Jack E. Gold, founder and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jgoldassociates.com/\">J.Gold Associates</a>, an IT advisory company in Northborough, Mass.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“In theory, you could just unplug the H100s and plug the Blackwells in,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Although you can do that theoretically, you might not be able to do that financially.” For example, Nvidia’s H100 chip costs $30,000 to $40,000 each. Although Nvidia didn’t reveal the price of its new AI chip line, pricing will probably be along those lines.</p>\n<p>Gold added that the Blackwell chips could help developers produce better AI applications. “The more data points you can analyze, the better the AI gets,” he explained. “What Nvidia is talking about with Blackwell is instead of being able to analyze billions of data points, you can analyze trillions.”</p>\n<p>Also announced at the GTC were Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM). “NIM tools are built on top of Nvidia’s CUDA platform and will enable businesses to bring custom applications and pretrained AI models into production environments, which should aid these firms in bringing new AI products to market,” Brian Colello, an equity strategist with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a>, in Chicago, wrote in an analyst’s note Tuesday.</p>\n<h3>Helping Deploy AI</h3>\n<p>“Big companies with data centers can adopt new technologies quickly and deploy them faster, but most human beings are in small and medium businesses that don’t have the resources to buy, customize, and deploy new technologies. Anything like NIM that can help them adopt new technology and deploy it more easily will be a benefit to them,” explained Shane Rau, a semiconductor analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a global market research company.</p>\n<p>“With NIM, you’ll find models specific to what you want to do,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Not everyone wants to do AI in general. They want to do AI that’s specifically relevant to their company or enterprise.”</p>\n<p>While NIM is not as exciting as the latest hardware designs, O’Donnell noted that it is significantly more important in the long run for several reasons.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“First,” he wrote, “it’s supposed to make it faster and more efficient for companies to move from GenAI experiments and POCs (proof of concepts) into real-world production. There simply aren’t enough data scientists and GenAI programming experts to go around, so many companies who’ve been eager to deploy GenAI have been limited by technical challenges. As a result, it’s great to see Nvidia helping ease this process.”</p>\n<p>“Second,” he continued, “these new microservices allow for the creation of an entire new revenue stream and business strategy for Nvidia because they can be licensed on a per GPU/per hour basis (as well as other variations). This could prove to be an important, long-lasting, and more diversified means of generating income for Nvidia, so even though it’s early days, this is going to be important to watch.”</p>\n<h3>Entrenched Leader</h3>\n<p>Rau predicted that Nvidia will remain entrenched as the AI processing platform of choice for the foreseeable future. “But competitors like AMD and Intel will be able to take modest portions of the GPU market,” he said. And because there are different chips you can use for AI — microprocessors, FPGAs, and ASICs — those competing technologies will be competing for market share and growing.”</p>\n<p>“There are very few threats to Nvidia’s dominance in this market,” added Abdullah Anwer Ahmed, founder of Serene Data Ops, a data management company in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“On top of their superior hardware, their software solution CUDA has been the foundation of the underlying AI segments for over a decade,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The main threat is that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft/OpenAI are working on building their own chips optimized around these models,” he continued. “Google already has their ‘TPU’ chip in production. Amazon and OpenAI have hinted at similar projects.”</p>\n<p>“In any case, building one’s own GPUs is an option only available to the absolute largest companies,” he added. “Most of the LLM industry will continue to buy Nvidia GPUs.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The U.S. Dept of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just passed a much more aggressive requirement that could significantly improve a car’s ability to avoid accidents.</p>\n<p>I’ve owned two electric cars so far and, sadly, totaled both of them.</p>\n<p>The first was totaled because a tow truck driver secured the car improperly when it needed to be towed back to the dealer. That mistake caused $100,000 worth of damage to a vehicle worth about half that much.</p>\n<p>In the second accident, the car nearly killed me after knocking me out. It then accelerated rapidly to around 50 mph, hit another car, and continued to accelerate into a rock wall (which was not amused). The accident-avoidance technology clearly failed or wasn’t enabled in this incident.</p>\n<p>Thus, the new Department of Transportation (DOT) rule requiring advanced safety tech on all new cars and trucks could have saved my car and me from breaking my back and potentially saved the life of anyone in a similar accident.</p>\n<p>This week, I’ll share what happened in that accident, why we need autonomous driving’s Guardian Angel feature, and why this new DOT rule is quite literally a lifesaver. We’ll close with my Product of the Week, the first operational Level 3 car based on Nvidia’s technology to be sold in the U.S.</p>\n<h3>My Auto Accident</h3>\n<p>Two days after being T-boned in what is one of the most dangerous intersections where I live, I found myself at that intersection after the sun went down. I was unable to see cross traffic well because it was so dark. I was scared half to death as cars were backed up around me. My view was blocked by a car on the right from seeing what was approaching from the right, and I couldn’t tell the distance of the vehicles coming from the left.</p>\n<p>Since my near accident had come from the left, I leaned forward as I entered the intersection not realizing that in the meantime, a car had approached from the right and blocked my passage (I was going straight). When I hit that car going around 15 mph, it fired the airbag, which knocked me out; my foot went to the floor, accelerating me into the car I hit (electric cars have a ton of torque), which pushed that car through the intersection and across the street.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>As I accelerated to around 50, I hit a curb, the car nearly jumped over a fence, and my back was broken in the process. I then rammed a rock wall after the airbag had deflated, totaling the car. When I came to, the police had already arrived, and the EMTs and fire trucks were just pulling up.</p>\n<p>I should add that so many people have had accidents at that intersection that they just made it into a four-way stop because there were several serious accidents after mine. The business owner on the corner had reported his parked vehicles were hit regularly in similar accidents.</p>\n<p>The plan is to turn that intersection into a traffic circle eventually, but given the lack of visibility, it should have always been a 4-way stop.</p>\n<h3>Electric Car Problem</h3>\n<p>In a gas car without cross-traffic alerting or active accident avoidance, if you hit a car as I did, the car would have stalled even if I’d tried to floor it, resulting in far less damage and injury. However, electric cars generate 100% torque from a stop, and, as I unfortunately found out, they can not only power through an accident, but they can continue to accelerate at supercar speeds afterward.</p>\n<p>Had I not hit that rock wall, I would have accelerated to triple digits and assured my death when I finally did hit something that would stop the car. So, I was lucky I hit that rock wall.</p>\n<p>This event exemplifies why electric cars need far more robust accident prevention technology than gas cars, at least for collisions that might knock the driver unconscious.</p>\n<h3>Autonomous Car Advantage</h3>\n<p>The current plan is that autonomous car technology will require a monthly fee to enable it (the tech will initially appear in most high-end electric vehicles). But if you don’t want the car to drive itself, it will also come with a free feature that Toyota once called Guardian Angel.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Guardian Angel uses autonomous car tech to prevent doing something stupid like I did. It will take control of the car if it senses you are doing something that could get you injured or killed. This technology will ensure that the lifesaving and injury-reducing features that autonomous car technology promises will be achieved.</p>\n<p>However, until the DOT ruling, it was unlikely this technology would be on anything but the most expensive and exclusive cars, not moving down market until closer to or after 2030.</p>\n<h3>DOT Steps In</h3>\n<p>However, last week, the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/icymi-safety-advocates-voice-support-biden-administrations-new-car-safety-rule-will\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DOT effectively mandated</a> that the collision prevention benefits from Guardian Angel will soon be required in all cars. This technology is required in electric vehicles to avoid accidents with cars and pedestrians through avoidance up to 62 mph and heavy braking up to 45 mph.</p>\n<p>While this requirement won’t kick in until 2029 so that people can get used to it as an option and to allow time to improve the technology, it will start appearing with the coming wave of autonomous vehicles through the Guardian Angel feature in the 2025 model year in cars like the Mercedes highlighted below as my Product of the Week.</p>\n<p>This implementation should not only force Guardian Angel down market to less expensive cars more quickly but also help ensure more people are protected than otherwise would have been by 2030.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Due to my recent accident and the related pain I’ll suffer for the rest of my life, I was extremely interested in this recent ruling by the DOT. This forced march to better collision avoidance would have saved my car and my back and better protected my life had it already been in place.</p>\n<p>The ruling will make electric cars, which can shrug off accidents that would stop gas cars, a great deal safer. It will also reduce accidents with other vehicles and massively reduce the number of pedestrians killed on roads. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>Also, hopefully, it will prevent me from ever totaling another car. But in the end, if you want to keep yourself and your family safe, consider cars with advanced accident avoidance as a way to assure premature death before this new DOT mandate takes place.</p>\n<p>Nice work, DOT!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Mercedes EQS With Level 3 Autonomous Driving</h3>\n<p>The Mercedes EQS electric and gas-powered S-Class are the first two cars approved for hands-off Level 3 autonomous driving in the U.S. Currently, they are only certified in California and Nevada, but I expect broader certification in the coming months.</p>\n<p>I’m focusing on the EQS and not the S-Class because the EQS is electric, which is where this technology, as a safety feature, will have the greatest impact, given the issue I noted above with electric cars. The <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/mercedes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technology</a>, which largely comes from Nvidia (again showcasing that company’s leadership in everything AI) is called <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/en/owners/manuals/drive-pilot \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drive Pilot</a> and will include advanced collision avoidance technology as all autonomous cars do.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mercedes-Benz DRIVE PILOT\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oo7uKsSPUs0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The EQS is a luxury vehicle typically costing north of $120,000, but it’s not a high-performing electric with a 0 to 60 time of close to 6 seconds. It does have 350 miles of range, though, making it one of the leaders in electric range.</p>\n<p>Be aware that if you want more than just the additional safety benefits, Drive Pilot will cost you around $2,500 per year. As a Level 3 system, it will only work hands-free on highways (Level 4 is cities, and 5 is complete human replacement). The EQS has both sedan and SUV configurations, and while the design isn’t as sporty as I’d like, it is still a very clean and nice-looking vehicle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Mercedes-Benz-EQS-Sedan.jpg\" alt=\"Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan for 2025 model year\" width=\"928\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Mercedes-Benz-EQS-Sedan.jpg 928w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Mercedes-Benz-EQS-Sedan-300x136.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Mercedes-Benz-EQS-Sedan-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px\"></p>\n<p>The 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQS Sedan will arrive at U.S. dealerships later in 2024. (Image Credit: Mercedes-Benz USA)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mercedes is already known as one of the safest brands in the Midsized Luxury Car market, and the EQS, with this advanced self-driving technology, should be one of its safest. By the way, they make <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/en/vehicles/class/eqs/sedan/type-amg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AMG</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/en/maybach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maybach</a> versions of this car, so you have higher performance and even more luxury choices, but the price quickly gets closer to $200,000 and is likely way too expensive for most.</p>\n<p>In the end, no one wants to be in an accident, and we all want to keep our families and pets safe. With Drive Pilot, the Mercedes EQS should be the safest electric car on the road in 2024 and is now my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Google’s dabbling with enhancing its search results with artificial intelligence could have dire consequences for anyone with a business that depends on Alphabet’s best-known subsidiary for web traffic.</p>\n<p>Anyone who’s done a Google search knows it’s already stuffing AI summaries into its search results, but it will be upping its ante in AI when a program called Search Generative Experience (SGE) exits its current experimental phase.</p>\n<p>According to Google, SGE will enrich searches by using AI to provide summaries, suggest further exploration paths, and allow for easy refinement of search queries. For content creators, though, the feature could be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>“SGE will impact many of the bloggers and publishers we’re all familiar with,” said Aaron Traub, owner of <a href=\"https://geauxseo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GeauxSEO</a>, an SEO and website design company in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>“Generally, any questions or topics that can be quickly answered with AI will eventually command the digital real estate space for these queries, eliminating many publishers currently ranking for these types of queries,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Chris Ferris, senior vice president of digital strategy at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.piercom.com\">Pierpont Communications</a>, a public relations agency in Houston, maintains that SGE will further erode the amount of website traffic businesses can count on from organic search.</p>\n<p>“Organic search traffic has been falling for years because Google PPC [pay-per-click] ads, “people also ask” suggestions, maps, etcetera, have pushed down what used to be top Google search results. SGE will just accelerate that even faster,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Impact of SGE on Organic Traffic</h3>\n<p>SGE essentially is the newest way for Google to keep users interacting with the search engine results page (SERP) and disincentivizing them from visiting the source content, asserted Joe Karasin, CMO and founder of Karasin PPC, a marketing agency that specializes in Google ads, in Lapeer, Mich.</p>\n<p>“For example,” he told TechNewsWorld, “if I write great content about the use of paid search ads, and the SGE chat answers questions about this directly for someone searching for it, why would they click to any search results?”</p>\n<p>“Currently, SGE isn’t being widely adopted, but it will eventually be forced on users, and this will lead to significant traffic decreases for websites and publishers and diminish the ad revenue sites gain from their traffic,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“SGE is the next phase in Google’s attempt to create a zero-click search experience,” he said. “They initially started with the SERP features, attempting to keep users on the results page rather than have them navigate away. Now, the SGE will be able to answer user queries in a seamless, conversational manner, even if the chatbot decides to hallucinate.”</p>\n<p>Since Google introduced SGE more than a year ago, people have debated its impact on creators and publishers, added Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a news, commentary, and analysis website. “While the product is evolving, the consensus is this: less visibility and less traffic to publishers,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfortunate for these small business owners, but SGE will push new developments in content creation and the value needed to stand out from AI-generated answers,” maintained GeauxSEO’s Taub. “In my opinion, topics that can only be fully answered by experts or large brands in their respective fields will win out.”</p>\n<h3>Drastic SEO Pivots May Be Premature</h3>\n<p>Kelly Ayres, SEO manager at <a href=\"https://www.jordandigitalmarketing.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jordan Digital Marketing</a>, a provider of digital marketing services in San Francisco, contends that SGE is still a big unknown because two unknown algorithms are driving it — the search algorithm and the algorithm driving the SGE results within the SERPs.</p>\n<p>“What we do know so far is that SGE is meant to keep users on the SERPs, not clicking through to websites, and it’s working,” she told TechNewsWorld. “We work with brands showing up in SGE content, but users aren’t clicking through the source links to the original content.”</p>\n<p>“What we’re also seeing is that brands showing up in SGE content are also ranking very well in traditional SERP listings, where they are driving clicks,” she added. “This tells me that SGE is drawing from a lot of the same principles as successful SEO in general, so I’m not sure marketers need to make any drastic pivots yet to improve their chances of placing in SGE content.”</p>\n<p>Creators and publishers may also see some benefits from SGE, argued Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“The Generative Experience tool can potentially transform how users interact with search results by summarizing and synthesizing information across multiple sources,” he told TechNewsWorld. “For creators and publishers, this means their content could be integrated into broader narratives, potentially reaching audiences who might not have discovered their work through traditional search queries.”</p>\n<p>“By providing more interactive and dynamically generated content, Google’s tool may increase user engagement,” he continued. “For creators, this means audiences might spend more time interacting with content presented in a new, more engaging format. Publishers might see this as an opportunity to capture and retain the attention of users who are becoming increasingly accustomed to interactive digital experiences.”</p>\n<h3>Challenges to Content Accuracy and Visibility</h3>\n<p>Vena added that the generative capabilities of Google’s tool may inspire creators to experiment with new types of content optimized for generative search experiences. “This could lead to innovative formats and storytelling techniques that are particularly effective in a synthesized information environment,” he said.</p>\n<p>He acknowledged, however, that with the increased use of AI to generate content summaries or integrated responses, there’s a valid concern about the integrity and authenticity of the information presented. “Creators and publishers may worry about the accuracy of how their content is represented or altered in generative summaries, which could impact their brand and the trust they’ve established with their audience,” he noted.</p>\n<p>Ayres pointed to another problem for content creators and publishers with SGE. “One downside of SGE and AI-generated query results is the proliferation of spam content or misinformation, making it difficult for authoritative experts and influential creators to keep visibility high,” she said. “Publishers might have to seek alternative content distribution avenues if SGE impacts their engagement and reach.”</p>\n<p>For Google’s part, it believes it can incorporate AI into its search results without disrupting the traffic so many of its users depend on for their livelihoods. Speaking on Alphabet’s earnings call in January, CEO Sundar Pichai observed: “We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries…[W]e are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, and we’ll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers.”</p>\n",

Users are first sent to a legitimate website, then redirected to the malicious site, a tactic that makes it difficult for the target to detect the switch.</p>\n<p>“Open redirect vulnerabilities can be fairly common and are easy to exploit,” noted Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla.</p>\n<p>“The power in them falls back to the cybercriminal’s favorite tool, deception,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The open redirect allows bad actors to use a legitimate URL to redirect to a malicious one by crafting the link in the message to include a part at the end of the URL, which is rarely checked by people, that takes the user to the malicious site, even if they know enough to hover over the link.”</p>\n<p>“While the URL in the browser will show the site the person is redirected to, the victim is less likely to check it after believing they have already clicked a legitimate link,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“It is common to teach people to hover over links to make sure they appear legitimate,” he added, “but they should also be taught to always review the URL in the browser bar before entering any sensitive information such as passwords, PII, or credit card numbers.”</p>\n<p>Email continues to be a primary delivery mechanism of attachment-based redirects, noted Patrick Harr, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a network security company in Pleasanton, Calif. “But,” he told TechNewsWorld, “we are also seeing delivery of these attachments outside of email in Slack, Teams, Discord and other messaging apps with obfuscated file names that look real.”</p>\n<h3>Exploiting BITS</h3>\n<p>Another notable attack identified in the report is using the Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to perform “living off the land” forays on an organization’s systems. Because BITS is a tool used by IT staff to download and upload files, attackers can use it to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>Ashley Leonard, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.syxsense.com\">Syxsense</a>, a global IT and security solutions company, explained that BITS is a component of Windows designed to transfer files in the background using idle network bandwidth. It’s commonly used to download updates in the background, ensuring a system stays up to date without disrupting work or for cloud synchronization, enabling cloud storage applications like OneDrive to sync files between a local machine and the cloud storage service.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Unfortunately, BITS can also be used in nefarious ways, as noted in the Wolf HP report,” Leonard told TechNewsWorld. “Malicious actors can use BITS for a number of activities — to exfiltrate data, for command-and-control communications or persistence activities, such as executing malicious code to entrench themselves more deeply into the enterprise.”</p>\n<p>“Microsoft doesn’t recommend disabling BITS because of its legitimate uses,” he said, “But there are ways enterprises can protect themselves against malicious actors exploiting it.” Those include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use network monitoring tools to detect unusual BITS traffic patterns, such as large amounts of data being transferred to external servers or suspicious domains.</li>\n<li>Configure BITS to allow only authorized applications and services to use it and block any attempts by unauthorized processes to access BITS.</li>\n<li>Segregate critical systems and data from less sensitive areas of the network to limit the lateral movement of attackers in case of a compromise.</li>\n<li>Keep all systems up to date with the latest patches and security updates to fix any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\n<li>Utilize threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures cyberattackers use, and proactively adjust security controls accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>RAT in the Invoice</h3>\n<p>The HP Wolf report also found network marauders hiding malware inside HTML files masquerading as vendor invoices. Once opened in a web browser, the files unleash a chain of events that deploy the open-source malware AsyncRAT.</p>\n<p>“The advantage of hiding malware in HTML files is that attackers rely on interacting with their target in most cases,” said Nick Hyatt, director of threat intelligence at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blackpointcyber.com\">Blackpoint Cyber</a>, a provider of threat hunting, detection, and response technology, in Ellicott City, Md.</p>\n<p>“By hiding malware in a fake invoice, an attacker is likely to get a user to click on it to see what the invoice is for,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This, in turn, gets the user interacting and increases the chance for successful compromise.”</p>\n<p>While targeting companies with invoice lures is one of the oldest tricks in the book, it can still be very effective and lucrative.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Employees working in finance departments are used to receiving invoices via email, so they are more likely to open them,” HP Wolf Principal Threat Researcher Patrick Schläpfer said in a statement. “If successful, attackers can quickly monetize their access by selling it to cybercriminal brokers or by deploying ransomware.”</p>\n<p>“The escalating threat landscape posed by highly evasive browser-based attacks is yet another reason organizations must prioritize browser security and deploy proactive cybersecurity measures,” added Patrick Tiquet, vice president for security and architecture at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company, in Chicago.</p>\n<p>The rapid surge in browser-based phishing attacks, especially those employing evasive tactics, highlights the urgent need for enhanced protection,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Less Than Impervious Gateway Scanners</h3>\n<p>Another report finding was that 12% of email threats identified by HP Wolf’s software had bypassed one or more email gateway scanners.</p>\n<p>“Email gateway scanners can be a helpful tool to eliminate the common types of email threats. However, they are far less effective at more targeted attacks, such as spearphishing or whaling,” observed KnowBe4’s Kron.</p>\n<p>“Email scanners, even ones that use AI, are typically looking for patterns or keywords or will look for threats in attachments or URLs,” he continued. If the bad actors use non-typical tactics, the filters may miss them.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“There is a fine line between filtering out threats and blocking legitimate email messages,” he said, “and in most cases, the filters will be set to being more conservative and less likely to cause problems by stopping important communication.”</p>\n<p>He acknowledged that email gateway scanners, even with their flaws, are vital security controls, but he asserted that it is also critical that employees be taught how to spot and quickly report attacks that make it through.</p>\n<p>“Bad actors are getting creative in designing email campaigns that bypass traditional detection mechanisms,” added Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zimperium.com\">Zimperium</a>, a mobile security company based in Dallas.</p>\n<p>“Organizations must protect their employees from phishing links, malicious QR codes, and malicious attachments in these emails across all legacy and mobile endpoints,” he said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Some software developers and companies are considering whether the open source movement is at a crossroads and needs to change direction.</p>\n<p>Open-source software (OSS), which originated in the 1960s with the advent of large-scale commercial computers, came bundled with freely distributed source code.</p>\n<p>Today, OSS is ubiquitous, thriving across all industries worldwide and even within proprietary systems. It is released under a jungle of licenses that grant users various rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software freely and allow anyone to review source code.</p>\n<p>However, a grassroots movement is growing partly due to frustrations with revenue and licensing concerns. Despite the success of the OSS’s five decades of growth, some software industry insiders are looking at ways to stop open-source license abuses and resolve other issues.</p>\n<h3>Open Source’s Critical Juncture</h3>\n<p>According to Ann Schlemmer, the CEO of longstanding open-source champion <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com\">Percona</a>, the OSS community is certainly justified in its frustration. She agrees that the open-source movement has arrived at a crossroads and requires much more careful, measured consideration.</p>\n<p>“This crossroads requires the open-source community to have a serious discussion around expectations for OSS moving forward, at the individual, organizational, and movement-wide levels,” Schlemmer told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>What might replace or at least fine-tune open source? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Perens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bruce Perens</a>, recognized as one of the founders of the open-source movement, is working on that premise. According to the free software pioneer, OSS licenses are not working anymore.</p>\n<p>“I’ve actually always been accepting of non-open-source approaches as long as they complied with one rule: Don’t call them Open Source!” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Saving, Not Destroying, Worthy Working Windfall</h3>\n<p>Perens collaborated with Monty Widenius, developer of the original open-source MySQL database, and Kai Arnaud, founder of the open-source MariaDB, on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Source License</a>. His goal was to make sure it did not dilute the open source brand and to make the timed outcome of BSL software becoming real open source more clear, he offered.</p>\n<p>Perens is one of the founders of what could come next: the Post-Open movement. He has written about what the next phase in the development of community-based software should be.</p>\n<p>“One of my criticisms of the Creative Commons was that it meant a lot of different rules, and the only thing they had in common was the right to read. In contrast, Open Source has a clear set of rules that have held up for 26 years now, and I wanted the Business Source License to similarly mean one thing rather than be fuzzy, he explained.</p>\n<h3>What Comes Next</h3>\n<p>Schlemmer and Perens share common ground on companies ignoring or abusing open-source licensing. Perens is not giving up on open source and sees it continuing.</p>\n<p>“What I’d like to do is meet some goals that open source hasn’t quite achieved. I seem to have agreement on that in general, as there has been surprisingly little push-back on this idea,” Perens insisted.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Schlemmer thinks the biggest problem is co-opting the open-source title and associated language within the industry.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Other not-so-open-source licenses are muddying the waters and causing increased confusion and uncertainty around what open source truly means,” said Schlemmer.</p>\n<p>Perens, however, is adamant about not changing open-source licenses. He is mainly speaking for independent open-source developers whose goal is to help other people rather than run a corporate welfare program for the world’s richest companies he offered.</p>\n<p>“Post-Open would have a different license and only one of them. Open source presently has around 100 licenses,” he noted.</p>\n<h3>Changing Times, Changing Directions</h3>\n<p>The OSS movement is in the midst of a midlife crisis, perhaps. For instance, it faces debates about how OSS principles should be applied to artificial intelligence and navigating increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“This sudden wave of open-source about-faces didn’t come out of nowhere,” Schlemmer explained. “It’s not a coincidence that this is happening. A tumultuous economy — especially within the tech sector — is causing organizations to experience more immediate economic pressure to generate revenue.”</p>\n<p>The result is forcing many open-source organizations to reconsider just how “open” they want their products to be. Not that this kind of bait-and-switch should be excused, Schlemmer offered.</p>\n<p>“But the fact that it is happening more and more does indicate that OSS is at a crossroads, and the community will have to face some difficult questions if they hope to fight back against this trend,” she said.</p>\n<p>Schlemmer views the move toward more restrictive licensing as overwhelming for the majority of organizations. For her, it is a direct response to increased economic pressure. The economy of the past few years has been far from stable, she remarked on the connection between free software concepts and the need to keep lights on for developers.</p>\n<p>“As a result, many businesses have found themselves under significant pressure to generate revenue and demonstrate profitability quickly,” she observed.</p>\n<h3>Pressing Problems Summarized</h3>\n<p>In Schlemmer’s view, most of the current challenges and controversies surrounding open source can be boiled down to one thing: How do we define open source, and what are the most viable licensing models for today’s world?</p>\n<p>“There have been some disagreement and debate around these matters for quite some time, but finding common ground is becoming both increasingly difficult and increasingly necessary as the technological and economic landscapes continue to change rapidly,” she offered.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>One particularly significant and contentious example is the question of how best to implement open-source principles in the field of AI. Because AI fundamentally differs from traditional software, existing open-source licenses and definitions are proving inadequate in the context of AI.</p>\n<p>“However, given the immense significance and potential of AI, it is imperative that the open-source community address these questions and come to a consensus around a new standard and/or type of license,” urged Schlemmer.</p>\n<h3>Making Changes May Fuel Unintended Consequences</h3>\n<p>Schlemmer sees a variety of support issues flaring up if open-source business practices shift gears. She thinks reactions will vary quite a bit depending on things like company size, budget, and in-house talent.</p>\n<p>“Reactions will also vary based on the company’s primary motivations for adopting open-source software in the first place,” she suggested.</p>\n<p>For businesses that look to open source solely as a cost-saving mechanism, that could mean increased hesitancy and more careful consideration of all their options, including proprietary ones, before adopting open-source solutions, said Schlemmer.</p>\n<p>However, the “free” aspect of OSS is far from the only reason organizations might opt for open source. Those who select open-source software for other reasons — such as ease of integration or access to community support — will be much less likely to translate their frustration into action.</p>\n<p>“With these key value propositions not on offer elsewhere, it will be hard for these types of organizations to “vote with their feet,” she added.</p>\n<h3>With Post-Open, Paying Matters</h3>\n<p>According to Perens, the interesting thing is that Post-Open is supposed to get developers paid. It’s not instant, though.</p>\n<p>“At this point, I am mostly talking with companies about funding. We need about US$200,000 right away, half for me to work on the policy and processes, and half to pay a lawyer to produce three documents and give some advice on the policy and processes,” he explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Entities that collect over $5 million in end-user revenue and those that wish to use the Post-Open software in sold products would be active in the money-making process — as would companies wanting to make proprietary modifications to the Post-Open software.</p>\n<p>They would all be required to audit and report on their Post-Open software use annually and pay us a small amount of their end-user revenue, 1% or less, he explained.</p>\n<p>“This is a lot easier than open source compliance today — and cheaper! Big companies spend $7 million per year on compliance,” Perens observed.</p>\n<h3>Prospects for Post-Open Success</h3>\n<p>If Post-Open gets up and running, it will take at least a year before companies report on its use and revenue starts flowing. Perens plans to provide support en masse for the whole Post-Open collection.</p>\n<p>“The support folks would work with the customer, and the open-source developers would maintain their projects without having to deal with the end-user, which I think a lot of them would be happy with,” Perens predicted.</p>\n<p>Open-source developers also have the option of dual-licensing with Post-Open. If they do, the Post-Open customers start paying them as part of the Post-Open instead of using the open-source license, noted Perens.</p>\n<p>“That’s part of the Post-Open agreement they have. So, the developers start making money,” he concluded.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) effectively tried to <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kill noncompete agreements</a> last week. While some companies plan to challenge this, it was the right decision to make.</p>\n<p>California — where I’ve spent most of my life — along with Minnesota, Oklahoma, and North Dakota, have already banned noncompetes. In California, this resulted not only in higher wages but also in the creation of Silicon Valley and provided a significant barrier to other states that didn’t have this ban regarding enticing employees to move.</p>\n<p>This national ban should result in more employees moving to states with lower living costs, increasing salaries and benefits, and providing much better work environments. It will also result in stronger companies, even though many who fear their employees may leave will fight this.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about noncompete agreements this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week: a performance electric car that is an absolute bargain used.</p>\n<h3>The Argument in Favor of Noncompetes Is Largely False</h3>\n<p>Companies often argue that noncompetes are critical to protecting their intellectual property in case departing employees take their proprietary knowledge to another company. But if they do that, the former employer is afforded substantial protection. If an investigation finds that technology did migrate with the employee, the old employer gets ownership rights over the products created using their technology.</p>\n<p>This kind of “theft” is surprisingly easy to prove. Patents, copyrights, and other protections over that intellectual property are in place, making technology theft, regardless of the method, excessively risky and expensive.</p>\n<p>As a result, someone in a critical position changing companies without a noncompete is put in an administrative position for around a year to ensure they don’t accidentally compromise the projects they are working on.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The real reason for noncompete agreements is to prevent employees from shopping for jobs to get higher pay or better benefits. The noncompete effectively locks them into their company unless they choose to switch careers or relocate to a state that prevents enforcement — which was and still is a frequent practice to circumvent noncompetes.</p>\n<p>This strategy enables companies to keep pay and benefits low for existing employees while increasing pay and benefits to attract external candidates, often resulting in huge salary and benefits differences between older and new hires.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the company doesn’t have to be competitive with existing employees since the noncompete effectively locks them into the company, and new hires will eventually find themselves in the same underpaid position as their older peers.</p>\n<h3>The Problem With Noncompetes</h3>\n<p>Whenever you lock employees into a job, you risk them realizing you are taking advantage of them and revolting.</p>\n<p>Revolt behavior could include theft of company assets, illicitly selling company secrets, union organizing (unions are not fans of noncompetes), lower morale, and reduced productivity. People who feel they are being taken advantage of but can’t afford to leave tend not to be top performers and may look for ways to reduce their contributions.</p>\n<p>This scenario is not only bad for the employee, who may eventually get fired for deficient performance, but it’s also bad for the company because it effectively creates a hostile work environment where the employer is actively working against the employee’s best interests.</p>\n<p>Thanks to California’s effective ban on noncompetes, I was able to leave my old company when they made decisions that I disagreed with, form my own company, and take my most valuable clients with me. Had a noncompete bound me, I’d have had to sit out a year, been unable to take my clients with me, and failed as an independent analyst.</p>\n<p>The lack of an enforceable noncompete gave me the freedom to protect and grow my career, find an independent path, and become more successful and happier than I otherwise would have been.</p>\n<h3>Noncompetes Are Employee Abuse</h3>\n<p>Changing companies is often the quickest way to advance your career and increase your income. However, if you stay at a company, especially one that enforces noncompete agreements, you might find that salary increases do not keep pace with the cost of living, even if you are a top performer.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The presence of a noncompete agreement discourages employees from seeking better opportunities or higher pay unless they are terminated. Being fired might free you from the noncompete, but it also tarnishes your employment record, which companies tend to disclose during background checks.</p>\n<p>This situation exemplifies how companies use their superior bargaining power and larger financial reserves to disadvantage their employees, effectively reducing their real compensation over time. As inflation increases, the purchasing power of employees’ incomes decreases as the cost of goods and services rises.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft’s Good Example</h3>\n<p>In 2022, Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/08/microsoft-announces-four-new-employee-workforce-initiatives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that in the U.S., only partners and executives would be subject to noncompetes, sparing its lower-level employees from the restriction.</p>\n<p>This policy isn’t abusive because executives are usually wealthy and can afford workarounds, such as taking jobs in a California company like Google, which will keep them financially whole. Plenty of Microsoft executives have moved to Google over the years, resulting in products like Android on smartphones, a segment in which Microsoft failed.</p>\n<p>In Microsoft’s case, the policy isn’t abusive so much as ill-advised because that supposed protection has resulted in a number of surprise critical departures over the years. It reflects bad governance in a company typically held up (for good reason) as one of the best-run technology companies in the world.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Noncompetes Are Bad for Everyone</h3>\n<p>Noncompetes are a form of lock-in, a practice that tends to be a company killer. I learned this firsthand at IBM, which used lock-in back in the 1980s to abuse customers to the degree that those customers abandoned the company, nearly putting it out of business a few short years from its 100-year anniversary.</p>\n<p>If the company believes you can’t leave, it isn’t motivated to improve benefits, salaries, and working conditions — or even to take complaints seriously. It creates an adversarial condition between employees and management, which can result in a variety of problems, not the least of which are unionization and employees acting out.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>Noncompetes are not good for the company, the employees, or the countries that allow them to exist because they foster employee abuse, even if it is only financial abuse, and that typically doesn’t end well.</p>\n<p>I regularly disagree with the FTC. I particularly didn’t agree with it going after Qualcomm to appease Apple, which was 20 times bigger and far more powerful than Qualcomm. However, when it comes to noncompetes, the FTC is on the right side of the argument. Noncompetes need to be abolished for the good of everyone because they are simply bad governance and employee abuse.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The Audi RS e-tron GT</h3>\n<p>I’ve been looking for a new electric car. I was on the list to get a Fisker Ocean, which recently became far more attractive due to massive price reductions. However, the reason behind these reductions was the company’s impending bankruptcy, and even at around 50% off, I wasn’t willing to risk not being able to get the car serviced should the company go under — although Fisker might be sold to a larger car company.</p>\n<p>The Audi e-tron GT and the Porsche Taycan are the same car in terms of performance, but I like the Audi’s look better. Typically, the cost of maintaining an Audi is less than that of a Porsche (though the Porsche conveys more status). Like with most electrics, the resale value of the Audi e-tron GT drops a lot after the first year, so you can find them for about half the price of a new one with 15,000 miles or less.</p>\n<p>Performance, particularly for the more expensive <a href=\"https://www.audiusa.com/us/web/en/models/e-tron-gt/rs-e-tron-gt/2024/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RS version</a>, is superior to many supercars and in line with the fastest Teslas (0-60 in 2.9 seconds for the RS) while providing better looks and interior comforts.</p>\n<p>For instance, the Audi R8, which is a supercar, does 0-60 in 3.2 seconds. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al5LbwMeN2Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drag races</a> between the two cars, which are $100,000 apart, are fun to watch, particularly if you don’t own an R8. The e-tron will dust the more expensive car in almost any stoplight race. (The R8 does have slightly better brakes.) It’s also one of the fastest-charging EVs on the market, though its range of around 250 miles is lower than I like.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Audi-RS-e-tron-GT.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Audi RS e-tron GT \" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Audi-RS-e-tron-GT.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Audi-RS-e-tron-GT-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Audi-RS-e-tron-GT-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>(Image Credit: Audi of America)</p>\n<p>You can find 2022 e-tron GTs with low mileage for under $50,000 and RS (pictured here) for under $75,000.

      "content": "<p>Apple beefed up its iPad product line Tuesday by upgrading the silicon in its Air models and introducing a new processor, the M4, into its Pro editions, which also got a display boost to OLED.</p>\n<p>“The iPad Pro with the M4 and outdoor viewable OLED screen is arguably the best tablet created so far,” Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The dual-layer OLED screens are the best screens ever used on a tablet and make the creative process much more realistic,” added Tim Bajarin, president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativestrategies.com/\">Creative Strategies</a>, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>The new 11-inch and 13-inch Pro models announced at an online, prerecorded event have displays made of two OLED panels for exceptional brightness.

(Image Credit: Apple)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A nano-texture glass option is also offered for the display. Nano-texture glass is engineered to scatter ambient light and reduce glare.</p>\n<p>Both the tandem OLED and etched glass overlay are unique, noted Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiriasresearch.com/\">Tirias Research</a>, a high-tech research and advisory firm, in Phoenix. “I have not seen this dual-layer OLED display solution before,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The etched glass overlay is also unique.”</p>\n<p>“The display is stunning,” Enderle said. “The only thing I wonder about is longevity. OLED is beautiful but not very robust, and they are pushing a lot of power through it. Longevity of the display could become an issue long term.”</p>\n<p>“As a photographer, I am excited to see how my images will look on it,” added Anshel Sag, a senior analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>“However, I am a little surprised they didn’t try to beef up the camera’s capabilities to really show off the display,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Enter M4 Silicon</h3>\n<p>In an unusual move, Apple introduced its next-generation M4 silicon into the new iPad Pro models. “Usually, next-gen chips are introduced on the Mac first,” Bajarin told TechNewsWorld. “Apple did this to emphasize their belief that the iPad is very much a PC as Jobs envisioned when he launched it 14 years ago, making it a powerful creative tool that mirrors the functionality mostly done on a PC.”</p>\n<p>The chip is built on second-generation three-nanometer technology, which is more power-efficient than its predecessors. Apple said the M4 can deliver the same performance as the M2 chip in the previous iPad Pro models, using half the power.</p>\n<p>According to Apple, the M4 delivers 50% faster CPU performance than the company’s M2 silicon and four times better overall performance than M2.</p>\n<p>“A new version of Apple silicon making its debut in an iPad is a shift from where we’ve historically seen it introduced. It is consistent, though, with Apple positioning iPad as a full-featured main computer option,” said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-M4-chip-Octane.jpg\" alt=\"iPad Pro with M4 silicon processor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-M4-chip-Octane.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-M4-chip-Octane-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-M4-chip-Octane-768x499.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Rendering performance in apps like Octane sees a substantial upgrade with the M4 chip, now up to four times faster than previous iPad Pro models equipped with the M2. (Image Credit: Apple)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“That they put their most advanced, highest-performance chip in the iPad lends credibility to their statements that they see the iPad as the future of the computer,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“They also released their professional apps on the platform,” he continued. “In some ways, that is a stronger endorsement of the iPad as a creative powerhouse. It also sends a strong signal to third-party developers, such as Adobe, that this an appropriate platform for those kinds of applications.”</p>\n<p>“That’s been challenging for Apple in the past because when they’ve talked about high performance, they’ve shown games on the iPhone and iPad,” he explained. “That can be a great visual showcase, but for a product that can cost north of $1,000 and has a professional label affixed to it, you need to show that the productivity tools and capabilities are there.”</p>\n<p>Mikako Kitagawa, a director and analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn., agreed. “I see Apple trying to sharpen up the position of iPad as the best tablet for the creative professionals,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Play To Boost Sales</h3>\n<p>Tirias’ McGregor reasoned that Apple will probably have different versions of the M4 for the various products in its portfolio, but introducing the chip in the iPad Pro is a significant move.</p>\n<p>“Coming out with this version specifically for the iPad Pro first makes a strong statement that Apple views the iPad as a critical product for the market, not an accessory product,” he said. “For many consumers, the iPad has become their primary computing platform.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a global market research company, concurred that introducing the M4 on the iPad Pro indicates Apple is taking the form factor seriously but still sees it as an add-on.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a MacBook replacement by any means. Rather, it’s a complementary device,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Beyond that, I think the timing around the release of the M4 also puts pressure on Qualcomm as their comparisons with the M3 are immediately outdated.”</p>\n<p>Apple’s motivation behind introducing the M4 in the iPad line may also be a reaction to sales numbers. “In the first six months of Apple’s fiscal 2024, which ends in September, iPad sales dropped more than 20% compared to the previous year, a worrying trend that Apple will be looking to reverse with today’s new models,” Felix Richter wrote for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/\">Statista</a> on Tuesday.</p>\n<h5>Apple’s iPad revenue and its share of the company’s total revenue</h5>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/ipad-revenue-chart.jpg\" alt=\"Chart showing Apple’s iPad revenue and its share of the company’s total revenue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/ipad-revenue-chart.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/ipad-revenue-chart-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/ipad-revenue-chart-768x538.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Will Kerwin, a technology equity analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago, agreed. “We believe this shows a recognition by the company that the iPad has been underperforming and warrants a priority in driving a return to growth,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Pencils and Palettes</h3>\n<p>In addition to the Pro models, Apple introduced two new iPad Airs, an 11-inch and, for the first time, a 13-inch model, both with M2 silicon under the hood. The starting prices for the iPad Air models are $599 for the 11-inch and $799 for the 13-inch. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999, while the 13-inch model will sell starting at $1,299. The Air and Pro models will be available for purchase on May 15.</p>\n<p>Two upgraded accessories were also announced at the Apple event: a new “magic” keyboard and a new pencil. Apple has added function keys to the keyboard, an aluminum palm rest, and a larger trackpad with haptic feedback.</p>\n<p>The new Apple pencil has a sensor that allows a new tool palette to appear on an iPad’s screen by squeezing the barrel of the stylus. A gyroscope allows the pencil to be used more precisely.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Pencil Pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-768x372.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Pencil Pro if misplaced.

Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“You can use that stylus across their portfolio of iPads using the squeeze capability,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That’s a significant time-saver. I do a little digital editing on the iPad, and the ability to remove masks or edit things on the screen with precision is a big deal.”</p>\n<p>“The Apple Pencil Pro is a big step forward in stylus capability for managing images and video content,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The hovering capabilities, the ability to change the orientation of tools by squeezing the pencil before the stylus touches the surface of the iPad are all nifty touches that add to the creative experience,” Rubin added.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Last week was Nvidia’s GTC, which I think should be renamed since we connect the “G” in GTC to GPU, and this event was mainly about AI. If you are interested in AI, you should watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2F8yisiS6E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keynote</a> from the event. It was fricken amazing! The Disney robots stole the show! I was there, and even though the venue sucked, I still place it as one of the most amazing events I’ve ever experienced in line with the Windows 95 launch. Other CEOs should use this keynote as the new standard for how these things should be done.</p>\n<p>After the event, we spent time with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. One of the things he repeated was that the decisions he made to make Nvidia’s leadership in AI happen were insane.</p>\n<p>Had he been an executive at any other company, he’d have likely been fired long before this effort was successful because, until generative AI took off, one thing that any other company’s CEO would have said was that Huang was nuts. He wasn’t, and now Nvidia is the world’s third most valuable tech company and challenging for number one.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week. You can’t buy it yet, but you’ll be able to experience it at Disneyland and Disney World. I’m talking about Disney BDX robots. I’m glad we can’t buy one, as I’d be in line right now waiting to get mine.</p>\n<h3>The Definition of Insanity Is Wrong</h3>\n<p>This has bugged me for a while. We typically define insanity as “doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” That isn’t insanity so much as it is considered stupidity. If you see someone doing something that hurts them and then doing it again, you don’t call them insane. You call them stupid. When you repeat a mistake you’ve made or observed, you didn’t learn the lesson. If learning is smart, not learning is stupid, not insane.</p>\n<p>If conventional knowledge says that flying faster than the speed of sound will kill you, then flying faster than the speed of sound is insane. If people believe the world is flat, trying to circumnavigate it would be insane. If everyone believes that going to the moon is impossible, spending millions to do it is insane.</p>\n<p>So, you could argue that everyone from Christopher Columbus to Nikola Tesla was insane (well, Tesla more than most), though I’d argue that those who drive the biggest change in our world are all insane — but in a good way. They don’t agree that what they are doing is impossible and execute to a level that when they are done, what we think of as impossible has changed.</p>\n<p>What Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has done with the <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/nvidia-raises-ante-in-ai-chip-game-with-new-blackwell-architecture-179079.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blackwell GPU and Hopper CPU</a> is pure insanity and incredibly brilliant, placing Nvidia at the point of the AI spear.</p>\n<h3>The God Mode GPU</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite movies on Hulu is called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGHD0bqjZWQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boss Mode</a>”. But if you’re a gamer, it likely should have been called God Mode. This is when you adjust the game settings so that you cannot lose, and it is a fun way to get through the story quickly without a lot of the skill, puzzle, or sequence learning that otherwise would be required.</p>\n<p>With Blackwell and Hopper, Nvidia has created the God Mode GPU solution. Just looking at what is already a big GPU is misleading because what truly makes this a God Mode GPU is that you will eventually be able to network a theoretically unlimited number of these things together, creating GPUs of unlimited size and capability.</p>\n<p>The eight years it took to develop this solution resulted in a potential 1,000 times increase in performance. This achievement challenges Moore’s law benchmark, which has defined the tech industry to date, equating to a 100-fold increase every decade.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Granted, right now, there are limits tied to the copper being used for much of the networking, but Nvidia is working to eliminate these limits with more advanced technology, suggesting it won’t be long until these limits are pushed. To make this work, every GPU is connected all the time to every other GPU, resulting in thousands of cables with a total length measuring miles in one rack.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that supercomputers may not be that much faster, but they’ll use a fraction of the power to accomplish the same results in the same amount of time. The example provided was a prior system with 8K GPUs that would take 90 days and use 15 megawatts of power for a large project. A new system based on Blackwell would require 2K GPUs for the same 90 days and use only 4 megawatts. More would be faster but require more power (no free lunch here).</p>\n<p>As Huang would typically say, the more you buy, the more you save, and potentially, the faster you can get things done.</p>\n<h3>Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Siemens</h3>\n<p>Four Nvidia partners were called out as leading their peers. Interestingly, the only client device shown throughout Huang’s keynote was not a PC from other vendors. It was Apple’s Vision Pro, arguing that it has the potential to be the new Apple II, foreshadowing the coming wave of true AI PCs, not the AI PCs we’ve been told to expect.</p>\n<p>This perspective makes a certain amount of sense in that the PC is based on the world as it existed in the 1970s when Xerox PARC conceived it and thought it was stupid. Then Apple built it successfully, and then Microsoft/IBM/Intel took it and made it even more successful (which is both sad and funny).</p>\n<p>Jensen referred to the new interface as the “Human Interface,” and I expect it will eventually replace the GUI, much like PCs replaced terminals, with the Apple Vision Pro being the current bar. Interestingly, while Steve Jobs was willing to correctly sacrifice the iPod to create the even more successful iPhone, Tim Cook isn’t Steve Jobs. He hasn’t yet made a similar decision, so it’s possible that Apple may miss this opportunity even though it has the chance to own it.</p>\n<p>Even though I think Lenovo has a better AI solution, it wasn’t at the event. However, Michael Dell was, so it was Dell that got called out by Huang as having the best solution even though Michael Dell never made it to the stage. I’d suggest you look at both the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/solutions/artificial-intelligence/index.htm \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell</a> and <a href=\"https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-hybrid-ai-solutions-delivering-power-of-generative-ai-to-enterprises-with-nvidia/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lenovo</a> solutions and make up your own mind. But I think Dell won this round. That’s interesting because, typically, Lenovo outplays Dell at events like this.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>When talking about cloud providers, Microsoft stood above the rest in its rapid embrace of Blackwell, working on a full duplicate of Nvidia’s implementation. Microsoft’s run to implement AI has been impressive, catching everyone by surprise. Recently, Microsoft hired executive staff from Inflection to run the AI effort, a move that emulated prior strategies with Xbox and the Cloud. I remain impressed with Microsoft’s execution here.</p>\n<p>AWS and Google are playing too, but AWS is limited by its retail nature (it just doesn’t push envelopes like this), and Alphabet (Google) still can’t seem to focus, so it’s lagging behind Microsoft’s efforts. Given who and what AWS is, this is fine, but Alphabet needs more focused and dynamic leadership because it should have beaten Microsoft but was left in the dust instead.</p>\n<p>Siemens got a lot of coverage for applied AI. I used to work for Siemens, and it’s impressive on large-scale projects and showcases the path that stumbling companies like Boeing should emulate to dig out of their poor-quality mess (any flight that lands with most of the parts still on the plane is a good one). Siemens is an example of how to use AI to build critical projects better, faster, with high quality, and cheaper, making it an excellent example of how most firms should implement AI, placing the company as the clear AI leader in its powerful class.</p>\n<h3>Computing vs. Generating</h3>\n<p>One of the things we will need to wrap our minds around is the difference between computing and generating.</p>\n<p>Current computers do what we direct them to do, whether that be word processing, <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/sourcetable-ai-spreadsheet-aims-to-democratize-data-analytics-179677.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spreadsheets</a>, or graphics. With AI, computers generate outcomes based on commands. Instead of having to write a document, the computer does that when you tell it what you want. If you want to analyze something, you tell the computer to analyze it; you don’t populate a spreadsheet. If you want a drawing, describe it and have the computer improve it.</p>\n<p>The user skill set is quite different. Office skills aren’t useful with AI, nor are skills with Acrobat. Even programming skills aren’t useful any more than knowing how to use a mechanical typewriter or calculator, which was useful after PCs became a thing. What is useful is command of the language and the ability to express your needs with complete, detailed concepts that the AI can then follow to create what you intend.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, building up AI skills may also help us become better communicators. But the people who will do best in this new world are those who are naturally better at communicating, not those who learn specific applications.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Where AI Should Be Initially Focused</h3>\n<p>I remain concerned that we are initially focusing AI on the wrong people, like the folks toward the bottom of a company or organization, rather than those at the top. What I mean is that if anyone in the rank and file of a company makes a mistake, it’s generally survivable, but if a CEO makes the same level of mistake, it can kill a company. In the military, the commander can lose the war while the soldier may lose their life. So, the most significant positive impact of AI assistance exists at the top, not the bottom, yet that is not where we are focused.</p>\n<p>The other area is a concept Toyota produced years ago regarding autonomous driving called Guardian Angel. In a car, this technology prevents you from doing something stupid like driving too fast, running a stop light, or otherwise needlessly putting your life and the lives of your passengers at risk (it seems like every week I read a story about an impaired or distracted driver killing a family as a result of stupidity).</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>Guardian Angel could be applied to life. If more of us had AIs that could help us make better decisions, we’d all be more affluent, less injured, have better relationships, and lead far happier and less unfortunately dramatic lives.</p>\n<p>Back to insanity. Ultimately, what Jensen Huang attempted with this new AI push would have been considered insane at any tech company I’ve ever worked for or with. He’d have been fired, demoted, forced out, lambasted, criticized, and, depending on his approach, even locked up for misuse of company resources. But the result will and is changing the world. We need to change the world to enable people with vision to do what may seem insane to create what earlier generations might have called magic.</p>\n<p>Huang and Nvidia have created a God Mode GPU. The word “magic” is inadequate to describe it. We need more CEOs like Jensen Huang.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Disney BDX Robots</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite products was the Sony Aibo. It was and still is an amazing robot. However, it shouldn’t have existed, given that it was extremely expensive for its time and wasn’t Sony’s most profitable offering.</p>\n<p>I was at the Aibo launch, and I recall there were two separate launch efforts, one for Japan and one for the rest of the world. Demand was so high for the first launch the thousands of robot dogs slated for Japan sold out in minutes. It took weeks for the international portal to open, not because demand was lower, but because it was so high Sony couldn’t keep the servers up long enough to complete transactions. It was the first unintended denial of service attack by buyers.</p>\n<p>Later versions of the Aibo were far more capable, but this first version, which would have cost around twice the Apple Vision Pro’s price in today’s dollars, became like a pet to many people. When the little robots failed or stopped working, it was like their actual pet died. This was even a plot line in some legal-based TV shows.</p>\n<p>Well, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51TYhPJ4zys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disney robots</a>&nbsp;(part of <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/project-gr00t \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Groot</a>) created with Nvidia’s Jetson robotic technology are like having little robotic kids.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Disney-BDX-robot.jpg\" alt=\"Disney BDX robot at NVIDIA GTC 2024\" width=\"500\" height=\"559\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Disney-BDX-robot.jpg 500w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Disney-BDX-robot-268x300.jpg 268w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<p>Disney BDX robot at Nvidia GTC 2024 (Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>Designed around the characters created in Star Wars, they walk on two legs, respond to spoken language (generative AI LLM models), have their own R2D2-like language, and can convey emotions.</p>\n<p>These robots don’t need to be fed, they don’t poop, and they could (with repairs) last for years, though they could also fall out of warranty.

      "content": "<p>How should policymakers handle the many concerns raised by the introduction of artificial intelligence into society? The <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://datainnovation.org\">Center for Data Innovation</a> (CDI) has some answers to that question in a report it released Monday.</p>\n<p>The 56-page document focuses on more than two dozen concerns raised by AI, each accompanied by a description of the issue along with a recommended policy response, if appropriate.</p>\n<p>Concerns are organized around an octet of subjects: privacy, workforce, society, consumers, markets, catastrophic scenarios, intellectual property, and safety and security.</p>\n<p>“Some concerns are legitimate, but others are not,” wrote report authors Hodan Omaar and Daniel Castro.</p>\n<p>“Some require immediate regulatory responses, but many do not,” they continued. “And a few require regulations addressing AI specifically, but most do not.”</p>\n<p>“Discerning which concerns merit responses and what types of policy action they warrant is necessary to craft targeted, impactful, and effective policies to address the real challenges AI poses while avoiding unnecessary regulatory burdens that will stifle innovation,” they added.</p>\n<p>The report comes on the heels of the release of the “Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Policy in the United States Senate,” a 31-page report outlining key priorities and recommendations for Senate committees to consider as they develop AI legislation and regulations.</p>\n<p>“The United States is on the right track with the roadmap the Senate released last week, but to turn the general guidelines into concrete actions, policymakers will have to be more discerning about what types of legislation they put forward to address different risks,” Omaar told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>No Mass Unemployment in Sight</h3>\n<p>Among the workforce concerns is AI may cause mass unemployment. The report downplayed that development.</p>\n<p>AI will likely bring changes to the types of work people do and create disruptions, it reasoned, but the economy has mechanisms and institutions in place to adapt and maintain overall employment levels as long as policymakers effectively manage these transitions. The challenge of AI is, therefore, not mass unemployment but greater levels of worker transition.</p>\n<p>Policymakers do not need to focus on concerns about mass unemployment from traditional AI adoption because the economic evidence does not support this materializing, the report argued.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Despite concerns about mass unemployment due to AI adoption, economic evidence suggests that this scenario is unlikely to materialize, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Studies indicate that while AI and automation may displace certain jobs, they also create new opportunities and demand for different skills, often leading to job transformation rather than elimination,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Historical trends show that technological advancements tend to increase productivity and economic growth, which in turn generate new jobs and industries.”</p>\n<p>“There are estimates that AI could create 97 million new jobs by 2025, outpacing the 85 million jobs it may displace,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Opening Up AI-Driven Careers</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhasse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Hasse</a>, a cybersecurity and technology consultant in Seattle, agreed that AI would have a positive impact on employment but didn’t share the CDI’s hands-off stance for policymakers.</p>\n<p>“Going forward, though, we have to assume AI will continue to evolve and expand in capabilities and quality and indeed be able to replace certain forms of work,” he told TechNewsWorld. “However, there are also broad expanses of opportunity being opened up as a result.”</p>\n<p>“In the long term, just as with the steam engine, electricity, or any of the many other modern marvels that had similar warnings, what we will see is a gradual shift of the affected portion of the workforce to new careers, and this is where some government support and oversight would be of some utility, though the specific form remains to be seen,” he added.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Some of those new careers have already started to appear, noted Brian Prince, founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://topaitools.com\">Top AI Tools</a>, an AI tool, resource, and educational platform in Boca Raton, Fla. “There are entire careers, from prompt engineers to chief AI officers that did not even exist just a few years ago,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It’s true that most people aren’t likely to be replaced by AI,” he said. “But they might be replaced by another worker who knows how to leverage AI to work smarter, not harder.”</p>\n<p>“We need to push for early education and skills-based training in the use of AI,” added Irina Tsukerman, president of <a href=\"https://scarabrising.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scarab Rising</a>, an actionable analysis services firm in Stratford, Conn.</p>\n<p>“That way, people not familiar with AI functions won’t be at a disadvantage as AI becomes more integrated into companies and processes,” she told TechNewsWorld. “People who have a rudimentary knowledge of AI will have a significant advantage over those who don’t. They don’t have to be AI jobs, but workers need to understand how job functions change as AI develops.”</p>\n<h3>AI Job Shuffle</h3>\n<p>However, Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., argues that the job displacement cycle fueled by AI will be different from those in past technology cycles.</p>\n<p>“Projects like Devin, the automated software engineer, and the work to create fully automated restaurants and self-driving long-haul trucks indicate that much of the focus on AI is to fill jobs that are currently unfilled,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“But the class of jobs most unfilled is new jobs that the transition to AI is creating,” Enderle continued. “This means that, unlike prior industrial revolutions, we aren’t just eliminating existing jobs but also preventing the creation of new job openings because these too will be filled by AI.”</p>\n<p>“The resulting <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/human-centered-ai-and-how-to-prevent-widespread-future-unemployment-179188.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">level of unemployment</a>, if not mitigated by making people more competitive with machines, has the potential to overwhelm the ability of governments to mitigate this crisis-level future problem,” he added.</p>\n<p>Society has already had a glimpse of what can go wrong with AI, noted Natalia Fritzen, an AI policy and compliance specialist with <a href=\"https://sumsub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sumsub</a>, a global identity verification company.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen multiple cases of what can happen without regulation — the <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/addressing-the-deepfake-risk-to-biometric-security-179171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">misuse of deepfakes</a>, widespread disinformation, leaked highly sensitive information — so governments must take the necessary measures to strengthen AI regulation for a more secure path forward,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>The Center for Data Innovation has made its report, “Picking the Right Policy Solutions for AI Concerns,” <a href=\"https://www2.datainnovation.org/2024-ai-policy-solutions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available for download</a>.

      "content": "<p>A Hong Kong bank recently fell victim to an impersonation scam in which a bank employee was tricked into transferring $25.6 million to thieves after a video call with the bank CFO and other colleagues. But none of them were real people — all were deepfakes created with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>This incident illustrates how cybercriminals can use deepfakes to trick humans and commit fraud. It also raises concerns about the threats that deepfakes pose to biometric authentication systems.</p>\n<p>The use of biometric markers to authenticate identities and access digital systems has exploded in the last decade and is expected to grow by more than 20% annually through 2030. Yet, like every advance in cybersecurity, the bad guys are not far behind.</p>\n<p>Anything that can be digitally sampled can be deepfaked — an image, video, audio, or even text to mimic the sender’s style and syntax. Equipped with any one of a half dozen widely available tools and a training dataset like YouTube videos, even an amateur can produce convincing deepfakes.</p>\n<p>Deepfake attacks on authentication come in two varieties, known as presentation and injection attacks.</p>\n<p>Presentation attacks involve presenting a fake image, rendering, or video to a camera or sensor for authentication. Some examples include:</p>\n<h4>Print attacks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2D image</li>\n<li>2D paper mask with eyes cut out</li>\n<li>Photo displayed on a smartphone</li>\n<li>3D layered mask</li>\n<li>Replay attack of a captured video of the legitimate user</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Deepfake attacks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Face swapping</li>\n<li>Lip syncing</li>\n<li>Voice cloning</li>\n<li>Gesture/expression transfer</li>\n<li>Text-to-speech</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Injection attacks involve manipulating the data stream or communication channel between the camera or scanner and the authentication system, similar to well-known man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Using automated software intended for application testing, a cybercriminal with access to an open device can inject a passing fingerprint or face ID into the authentication process, bypassing security measures and gaining unauthorized access to online services. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uploading synthetic media</li>\n<li>Streaming media through a virtual device (e.g., cameras)</li>\n<li>Manipulating data between a web browser and server (i.e., man in the middle)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defending Against Deepfakes</h3>\n<p>Several countermeasures offer protection against these attacks, often centered on establishing if the biometric marker comes from a real, live person.</p>\n<p>Liveness testing techniques include analyzing facial movements or verifying 3D depth information to confirm a facial match, examining the movement and texture of the iris (optical), sensing electronic impulses (capacitive), and verifying a fingerprint below the skin surface (ultrasonic).</p>\n<p>This approach is the first line of defense against most kinds of deepfakes, but it can affect the user experience, as it requires participation from the user. There are two types of liveness checks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Passive protection</strong> runs in the background without requiring users’ input to verify their identity. It may not create friction but offers less protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Active methods</strong>, which require users to perform an action in real time, such as smiling or speaking to attest the user is live, offer more security while modifying the user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In response to these new threats, organizations must prioritize which assets require the higher level of security involved in active liveness testing and when it is not required. Many regulatory and compliance standards today require liveness detection, and many more may in the future, as more incidents such as the Hong Kong bank fraud come to light.</p>\n<h3>Best Practices Against Deepfakes</h3>\n<p>A multi-layered approach is necessary to combat deepfakes effectively, incorporating both active and passive liveness checks. Active liveness requires the user to perform randomized expressions, while passive liveness operates without the user’s direct involvement, ensuring robust verification.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In addition, true-depth camera functionality is needed to prevent presentation attacks and protect against device manipulation used in injection attacks. Finally, organizations should consider the following best practices to safeguard against deepfakes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anti-Spoofing Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms that detect and differentiate between genuine biometric data and spoofed data can catch fakes and authenticate the identity. They can analyze factors like texture, temperature, color, movement, and data injections to determine the authenticity of a biometric marker. For example, <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/stories/deepfake-detection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intel’s FakeCatcher</a> looks for subtle changes in the pixels of a video that show changes in blood flow to the face to determine if a video is real or fake.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Ensure that biometric data is encrypted during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access. Strict access controls and encryption protocols can head off man-in-the-middle and protocol injections that could compromise the validity of an identity.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive Authentication:</strong> Use additional signals to verify user identity based on factors such as networks, devices, applications, and context to appropriately present authentication or re-authentication methods based on the risk level of a request or transaction.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-Layered Defense:</strong> Relying on static or stream analysis of videos/photos to verify a user’s identity can result in bad actors circumventing current defense mechanisms. By augmenting high-risk transactions (e.g., cash wire transfers) with a verified, digitally signed credential, sensitive operations can be protected with a reusable digital identity. With this approach, video calls could be supplemented with a green checkmark that states, “This person has been independently verified.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strengthening Identity Management Systems</h3>\n<p>It’s important to remember that simply replacing passwords with biometric authentication is not a foolproof defense against identity attacks unless it’s part of a comprehensive identity and access management strategy that addresses transactional risk, fraud prevention, and spoofing attacks.</p>\n<p>To effectively counteract the sophisticated threats posed by deepfake technologies, organizations must enhance their identity and access management systems with the latest advancements in detection and encryption technologies. This proactive approach will not only reinforce the security of biometric systems but also advance the overall resilience of digital infrastructures against emerging cyberthreats.</p>\n<p>Prioritizing these strategies will be essential in protecting against identity theft and ensuring the long-term reliability of biometric authentication.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AMD just got the nod from Microsoft that its new mobile Ryzen AI 300 series processors will now be capable of running Microsoft’s advanced AI applications, which are marketed under the brand name Copilot+. AMD is also the supplier to Microsoft Xbox, and with Microsoft heavily focused on AI, it is only a matter of time before the AI Xbox is announced.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about what to expect when the AI Xbox comes to market next year, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new AI-enabled processor from Intel Lunar Lake.</p>\n<h3>The AI Xbox</h3>\n<p>Xbox — and, to be fair, PlayStation — sales are down sharply this year, mainly due to the lack of new hardware releases. Normally, a new, lower-cost platform would have been introduced by now. However, with processor manufacturing plants (fabs) operating at full capacity, there hasn’t been room to produce the kind of low-cost processor that would have fueled a sales pop this year.</p>\n<p>However, the next major release should be fascinating. I anticipate a lower-cost version of the Ryzen AI 300 series accelerated processing unit (APU) with a powerful neural processing unit (NPU) will be available as early as next year. That will deliver amazing new capabilities in new and revised Xbox games.</p>\n<h3>AI Games Are Coming, Look for AI NPCs</h3>\n<p>Nvidia has been aggressively pushing the concept of AI NPCs (non-player characters). But right now, Nvidia isn’t in any gaming consoles. Instead, AMD has captured both Microsoft’s and Sony’s gaming platforms. Sony must know that if it doesn’t have AI-enabled games when the AI Xbox launches, it will lose a ton of share because AI games are expected to be game changers.</p>\n<p>The concept of an AI NPC is an NPC that behaves more like humans. It can engage in conversation. You don’t need to use canned prompts and trial-and-error or spend a lot of time on the web looking for cheats to figure out how to get through the game or solve a puzzle.</p>\n<p>In addition, with many games, it is more fun to play with others, but it is often hard to find teams that will take in new players or cater to players who may be socially awkward. I’m expecting a host of AI tools that could help people learn to flirt appropriately and overcome this social awkwardness without the downside of trying to learn with real people who can be pretty cruel if you get it wrong.</p>\n<h3>AI Party Members</h3>\n<p>So, imagine being able to fill a team with AI NPCs that you either build over time or are based on alternative game avatars. For instance, in one game I play, I have 61 game avatars that I’ve fully developed, and it would be fun to either fight them or build a team with them if I can’t find someone online to play with. For many of us who have experienced griefers, bullies, and rude players while gaming, this could also be a way for the most sensitive of us to have a fun, safe gaming experience. Another advantage of AI NPCs is the ability of the game to be more dynamic.</p>\n<p>Most video games today are pretty scripted, so once we’ve been through them a few times, they tend to feel old and stale. But with AI NPCs, even when people aren’t playing, the NPCs could interact with each other to change trials, rewards, and the way you progress through the game, suggesting subsequent gameplay will be the same with new surprises every time you log in and play.</p>\n<p>This same AI-driven approach also points to the ability to AI-enable games beyond the NPCs so that games can modify themselves based on gamer feedback and observations tied to metrics that show players are becoming angry or frustrated and working autonomously to address and remove the cause of this frustration and anger.</p>\n<h3>AI Mods</h3>\n<p>Moderators in games tend to be few, not very helpful, and anything but timely. I’ve had mods respond to complaints hours or even days after I no longer needed them, which is really annoying. You often need answers and help in real time.</p>\n<p>For instance, say you’ve just spent several hours trying to complete a quest, and an NPC gets stuck in a wall, floor, or ceiling, preventing you from progressing and forcing you to start over without achieving any of the goals or rewards that your time and success would have otherwise generated.</p>\n<p>An AI moderator could respond instantly. In fact, it could monitor your gameplay and make suggestions, and when a problem looks to be emerging, it could proactively prevent that emergence. Have you ever quit a new game after asking a valid question, only to be bombarded by a host of snarky people questioning your age and intelligence?</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>It can be hard for a new player to ask questions because of the grief they’ll get, but we’re all newbies (noobs) at one time or another. There have been several games where I struggled to understand the gameplay, asked a question, and then stopped playing the game because the response angered me so much.</p>\n<p>Mods have always been overworked because the position tends to be understaffed. Still, an AI mod can scale up according to the number of players, which would allow for faster rulings and better help for both noobs and experienced players who don’t want to come off as noobs.</p>\n<p>Plus, this scale should allow the AI mod to respond more quickly to griefers and bullies, potentially eliminating this behavior from the games that have this feature.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>I think the AI Xbox will be a massive game-changer. It will enable more dynamic games and NPCs that are more like humans and potentially create a safer gaming environment.</p>\n<p>Years ago, Microsoft launched an avatar-based social network targeting young women. I was given an ID and password to observe the interaction (which made me very nervous, given the girls were all underage), only to find a man with two daughters running around with a penis avatar.

In fact, the part code-named Lunar Lake and marketed under the brand Core Ultra is incredibly impressive.</p>\n<p>This processor is unusual because it was fast-tracked from its original 2026 release date, representing some of the fastest work Intel has ever done. Because of its advanced nature, it will hit the market as a premium product and should be the most advanced laptop mobile processor.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Intel-Core-Ultra-200V-event.jpg\" alt=\"Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors launch event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Intel-Core-Ultra-200V-event.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Intel-Core-Ultra-200V-event-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Intel-Core-Ultra-200V-event-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Sept. 3, 2024 — Pavan Davuluri (right), corporate vice president for Windows + Devices at Microsoft, joins Michelle Johnston Holthaus, executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel, at a launch event in advance of IFA Berlin to introduce Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors.

      "content": "<p>While the technology behind AI-powered chatbots quickly captured the public imagination, an even more powerful application of generative artificial intelligence has been creating a buzz among business leaders. It’s called agentic AI.</p>\n<p>“This innovative technology is not just another industry buzzword; it’s a paradigm shift that’s poised to redefine the boundaries of AI capabilities,” tech guru <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bernard Marr</a> wrote Monday in his Intelligence Revolution newsletter.</p>\n<p>“At its core, agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess a degree of autonomy and can act on their own to achieve specific goals,” he noted. “Unlike traditional AI models that simply respond to prompts or execute predefined tasks, agentic AI can make decisions, plan actions, and even learn from its experiences — all in pursuit of objectives set by its human creators.”</p>\n<p>“Agentic AI is the hottest thing going right now,” observed Jason Wong, a vice president analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn.</p>\n<p>He explained that the technology will not only understand intent and do very simple things like retrieve information and generate some response based on that, but it can also take action. “So, it could retrieve an API or a tool. Or even generate code, like generating Python code to solve a problem,” Wong told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The agency behind it is highly variable, but it’s AI coupled with tooling,” he continued. “It has the ability to plan how to address your question, your problem, and then activate the tooling and solve your problem.”</p>\n<h3>Step Beyond Gen AI</h3>\n<p>Scott Dylan, founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nexatechventures.com\">NexaTech Ventures</a>, a venture capital firm in Manchester, England, maintained that agentic AI takes a significant step beyond generative AI. “While generative AI focuses on creating content — text, images, code — based on existing data, agentic AI has a sense of autonomy,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It can make decisions, take actions, and adapt in real-time without needing constant human input.”</p>\n<p>“Think of it as moving from a tool that provides suggestions to one that independently executes tasks, learning from the environment it’s deployed in,” he said.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI represents a significant evolution from traditional generative AI by incorporating self-prompted reasoning, dynamic compute allocation and adaptive problem-solving capabilities, added Dev Nag, CEO and founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.querypal.com\">QueryPal</a>, an enterprise chatbot in San Francisco.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Unlike generative AI, which primarily focuses on producing content based on input prompts, agentic AI can autonomously allocate more ‘thinking time’ to complex tasks, employ hidden chain-of-thought search spaces, and utilize reinforcement learning to optimize its reasoning processes,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“This shift allows agentic AI to tackle more sophisticated problems and adapt its approach based on the task at hand, moving beyond mere text generation to more human-like problem-solving across various domains of tokenizable data,” he said. “It’s fair to say that modern agentic AI — like <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAI’s o1</a> — builds on generative AI as its infrastructure but can accomplish a wider range of goals.”</p>\n<h3>Transformative Technology</h3>\n<p>Agentic AI’s powerful capabilities can be transformational for many businesses.</p>\n<p>“Agentic AI can transform industries by automating not just repetitive tasks but also complex decision-making processes. For example, in supply chain management, agentic AI could predict and react to disruptions in real-time, optimizing routes and inventory without human intervention,” Hodan Omaar, a senior AI policy analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://datainnovation.org\">Center for Data Innovation</a>, a think tank studying the intersection of data, technology, and public policy in Washington, D.C. told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Businesses are on the verge of a massive shift due to agentic AI,” Dylan added. “It’s not just about automating processes but empowering systems to handle complex decision-making. In finance, that level of autonomy could drive more personalized customer service and fraud prevention systems that evolve with the threat landscape without the need for constant human oversight.”</p>\n<p>“One aspect that excites me is its potential in fields like health care,” he said. “Imagine a health care system that not only diagnoses based on symptoms but actively monitors patients post-diagnosis, adapting treatment plans as it learns from ongoing data. While this is a long-term vision, the groundwork being laid by agentic AI is getting us closer to that reality.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Nag maintained that agentic AI could revolutionize fields like law, medicine, and finance by automating complex cognitive tasks, potentially displacing jobs involving routine analysis but also creating new roles focused on AI oversight and human-AI collaboration.</p>\n<p>“The ability of agentic AI to scale at runtime to solve increasingly difficult problems without necessarily requiring larger models or more training data could democratize access to advanced AI capabilities, allowing smaller businesses to leverage powerful AI tools,” he added.</p>\n<p>“This new paradigm of runtime scaling introduces a novel dimension to AI development beyond just hardware and training data scaling, which have been the battleground among AI companies for the last two years,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Shared Brain, Shared Problems</h3>\n<p>Like generative AI, agentic AI has its problems. “Inevitably, because AI agents use a language model as their ‘brain,’ they share at least all the problems that generative AI does and then some,” noted Sandi Besen, an applied AI researcher at IBM and <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.neudesic.com\">Neudesic</a>, a global professional services company.</p>\n<p>“Additionally, when you start using multiple agents in tandem and provide them with the ability to work with one another, the innate variability that exists in generative AI is compounded,” she told TechNewsWorld. “However, there are certainly methods you can use to mitigate against this, such as ensuring there is proper evaluation and human in the loop included in the AI system.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Agentic AI, like other forms of AI, has the potential to advance users’ productivity. By carrying out the multiple steps involved in many tasks, it is able to automate more work and save users both time and money,” added David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.</p>\n<p>“While some will inevitably use such an AI tool for malicious reasons or to create content that some find offensive, the many positive applications of this technology means it should be allowed to flourish, free from burdensome government regulation like what we see in the EU,” he told TechNewsWorld. “As a result of such regulations, major tech companies are already withholding new AI tools in Europe, leaving Europeans worse off.”</p>\n<h3>Closer to AGI?</h3>\n<p>Since agentic AI gives gen AI the power to act, does it advance the field closer to the holy grail of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and true thinking machines?</p>\n<p>“A fundamental trait of general intelligence, whether in humans or animals, is the ability to adapt — sensing environmental signals, responding to them, and learning from those responses. In this regard, agentic AI marks a small yet meaningful step toward general intelligence.” Rogers Jeffrey Leo John, co-founder and CTO of <a href=\"https://datachat.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DataChat</a>, a no-code, generative AI platform for analytics, in Madison, Wisc., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“However,” he added, “we are still far from reaching true general intelligence, which would be capable of applying knowledge acquired from one situation to a completely different context.”</p>\n<p>Shawn DuBravac, CEO and president of the <a href=\"https://avrioinstitute.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Avrio Institute</a>, a technology consulting firm for CxOs and executives, also in Madison, doubted agentic AI would be a path toward AGI. “I would argue that agentic AI is not a precursor of AGI,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It’s not clear we reach AGI through linear progression from current AI technologies like agentic AI.”</p>\n<p>“In fact, I think it will be unlikely,” he continued. “If we reach AGI, I believe the path will involve breakthroughs and new paradigms of intelligence that differ significantly from what we have accomplished so far and what we are likely to accomplish in the coming years.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>An effective approach to children’s online safety needs to strike a balance between protecting kids’ user privacy and free speech, as well as distributing responsibility to the government, online services, and parents, according to a report released Monday by a Washington, D.C. technology think tank.</p>\n<p>No amount of regulation will completely eradicate all potential harms that children face in the digital and physical worlds, acknowledged the report by the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itif.org/\">Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation</a> (ITIF). However, for the regulation that is needed, a balance should be struck to address concrete harms without overly infringing on everyday Americans’ civil liberties, including their rights to privacy and free speech.</p>\n<p>The report, written by ITIF Policy Manager Ashley Johnson, continued that regulations sometimes infringe on adults’ rights to privacy and free speech and on the rights of the very children they aim to protect.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it added, if not designed appropriately, these kinds of rules can trample on children’s right to engage with their friends and access appropriate information online.</p>\n<p>The 32-page report discusses existing legislation in the online child-protection domain, in addition to key issues such as child privacy, age verification, protection from harmful content, and child labor exploitation. It also includes 10 recommendations for an effective approach to child online safety.</p>\n<h3>Imperfect Public Policy</h3>\n<p>“The ITIF report highlights the complexities involved in protecting children’s safety online while upholding user rights, enabling innovation, and respecting family autonomy,” observed Michael Davis, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://www.merek.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Merek Security Solutions</a>, a data protection and risk management company, in Santa Fe, N.M.</p>\n<p>“Many proposed measures, like overly broad age verification mandates or blunt COPPA expansions, risk being counterproductive — unduly restricting positive online experiences for kids, stifling digital ecosystems, and infringing on civil liberties,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Most would agree with the report’s contention that many current proposals to protect children online do not strike the right balance and risk overburdening parents and businesses or infringing user rights,” he added.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>David Redekop, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://adamnet.works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADAMnetworks</a>, a network security company in London, Ontario, Canada, agreed that any public policy attempted to date has been an imperfect solution. “Mostly because the problem that needs to be solved deals with <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/tech-coalition-launches-initiative-to-crackdown-on-nomadic-child-predators-178773.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predatory behavior</a> of the worst kind, with no borders, and against the most vulnerable of people: children,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“When we combine that with a culture that spends less parent-child time than in previous generations, the problem is multi-faceted and cannot conceivably be solved with public policy alone,” he continued. “It necessarily needs to become the priority of parents first.”</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately,” said Redekop, “that leaves many children vulnerable, especially ones in single-parent homes.”</p>\n<h3>Perils of Expanding COPPA</h3>\n<p>The report recommends that the FTC update its Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) rules to reflect technological changes since 2013, including allowing operators to conduct an analysis of their audience composition to avoid classification as a child-directed service while maintaining COPPA’s actual knowledge standard.</p>\n<p>There have been calls in Congress to change that standard to “knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances,” in addition to expanding the act to 16-year-olds.</p>\n<p>“Extending COPPA protections to teenagers ages 13 to 16 could lead many services to stop providing offerings for that age group to avoid compliance costs and liability risks,” Merek’s Davis said.</p>\n<p>“Switching from an ‘actual knowledge’ to an ‘implied knowledge’ standard would create a compliance minefield for services operating in good faith,” he added.</p>\n<p>The report noted that expanding COPPA to 16-year-olds will likely lead to less innovation in online services designed for children and teens. This means less educational content and wholesome entertainment, which many families rely on to keep children engaged and learning.</p>\n<p>It also means fewer online social spaces for teens, which have become an integral part of the average American teenager’s social life and development, it added.</p>\n<p>However, the report recommended that Congress amend COPPA’s actual knowledge standard so that websites directed at a general audience with common features, such as user feedback forms or customer service chatbots, are not required to obtain parental consent to collect information from users indicated as children.</p>\n<h3>‘Trustworthy Child Flag’</h3>\n<p>The report calls on Congress to mandate device operating systems to create an opt-in “trustworthy child flag” for user accounts, available when first setting up a device and later in a device’s settings, that signals to apps and websites that a user is underage, requiring apps and websites that serve age-restricted content to check for this signal for their users and block underage users from this content.</p>\n<p>ITIF’s Johnson maintained that social media platforms need to give parents more controls, like the trustworthy child flag. “Social media platforms giving parents more control would be a really important step,” she said.</p>\n<p>Interoperability is also important, she added, so parents can easily move controls from one platform to another.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The report recommends that Congress pass legislation establishing a government-led forum to construct a voluntary industry standard for interoperability on cross-platform parental controls, which would enable parents to create universal limits on their children’s online behavior across multiple devices.</p>\n<p>“Parental controls are part of the solution,” agreed David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C., think tank.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of parental controls out there, but parents don’t know how many of them they can use. They’re underused,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“If you want more safety, if you want more options for parental control or age verification or whatever, the tools are going to come from the private sector,” he said.</p>\n<p>He argued that government mandates won’t solve the online child safety problem. “I don’t think the mandates will result in what the government thinks they will result in,” he declared. “Instead, I think they will cripple innovation. The reason these companies are in the U.S. is because we’ve had great success allowing companies to innovate and create new products.”</p>\n<h3>More Recommendations for Improving Online Child Safety</h3>\n<p>Other recommendations offered in the report included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Congress should pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation that addresses actual privacy harms and preempts state laws, creating a single set of protections for all Americans. The act should include additional protections for children between ages 13 and 17, such as opt-in consent to collect and share teenagers’ data, while adults would be able to opt out of <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/personal-data-harvesting-and-how-to-reduce-your-digital-footprint-178046.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data collection</a> and sharing.</li>\n<li>Congress should pass legislation creating a national, interoperable framework for securely issuing and validating digital IDs across all levels of government and directing the Department of Homeland Security to begin issuing those digital IDs upon request, with grants for states to upgrade their systems for issuing driver’s licenses and other identity credentials to support digital IDs that can serve as privacy-protective forms of online age verification for adults.</li>\n<li>Congress should provide more funding for research and testing of photo-based AI age estimation and direct the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) to conduct an up-to-date empirical evaluation of age estimation algorithms and their accuracy.</li>\n<li>Congress should increase funding for law enforcement to investigate child sexual abuse material reports and prosecute perpetrators, including by increasing funding for ICAC task forces, police technology, and police training to keep up with perpetrators’ continuously evolving methodology.</li>\n<li>Congress should pass federal legislation similar to the Coogan Act and Indiana’s child influencer legislation that protects child performers in traditional and digital media by requiring parents to set aside a portion of a child’s earnings in a trust that the child can access upon reaching adulthood.</li>\n<li>Congress should provide funding for digital literacy campaigns that teach children how to stay safe online and parents how to keep their children safe online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ITIF report, “<a href=\"https://www2.itif.org/2024-child-online-safety.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Address Children’s Online Safety in the United States</a>,” is available without completing a form.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Deception is critical to the malevolent activity of Black Hat hackers, but, as Microsoft recently showed, it can also be a powerful weapon against those hackers.</p>\n<p>At a BSides event earlier this year in Exeter, England, the software maker’s “head of deception,” Ross Bevington, described an ambitious project that lured cybercriminals into realistic-looking honeypot tenants with access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud to gather intelligence about them and disrupt their operations.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft, it monitors some 25,000 phishing sites daily, feeding about 20% of them with the honeypot credentials. Once an attacker logs into the fake tenant, their every action is logged, allowing Microsoft to learn the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).</p>\n<p>“I worked for Microsoft for 11 years and deployed deception technology for some of its customers and was involved in internal projects that used deception technologies. As far as I can tell from the very limited details, this seems to be a large-scale deception project,” said Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla.</p>\n<p>“Most deception projects involve one or a few deception endpoints,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This one seems to involve a bunch of fake tenants with hundreds of fake users and simulated content. That’s pretty big as far as deception projects go.”</p>\n<h3>Playing Mind Game With Baddies</h3>\n<p>“During Microsoft’s presentation at BSides, one thing caught my eye: the fake Azure tenants being used to map the infrastructure of the phishing schemes,” added Chris Dukich, founder of <a href=\"https://displaynow.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Display Now</a>, a digital signage company in Boston.</p>\n<p>“That is a new level of deception that gives Microsoft the benefit of being able to gather intelligence on phishers around the world and neutralize them before they deploy their attacks en masse,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Stephen Kowski, field CTO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a computer and network security company in Pleasanton, Calif., noted that Microsoft’s approach of using fake Azure tenants represented an innovative shift in deception tactics.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid:

they’ve created a more scalable and dynamic honeypot environment,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This method allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of attacker behavior within a controlled, yet realistic, cloud ecosystem, providing deeper insights into sophisticated phishing operations.”</p>\n<p>In addition to explaining its honeypot scheme, the BSides session may have had another purpose for Microsoft. “Deception technology isn’t something defenders often talk about,” said Casey Ellis, founder and advisor of San Francisco-based <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bugcrowd.com/\">Bugcrowd</a>, which operates a crowdsourced bug bounty platform. “A part of its utility comes from the fact that it looks exactly like a live system, so the typical deployment approach is a silent one.”</p>\n<p>“By announcing that they are doing this, Microsoft is playing a bit of a mind game with the bad guys,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Deception Tactic Not for Everyone</h3>\n<p>As Microsoft has illustrated, deception can be an effective tool for thwarting digital desperadoes, but it isn’t for everyone. “Deception tactics do take quite a few resources,” acknowledged Vaclav Vincalek, a virtual CTO and founder of <a href=\"https://555vcto.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">555vCTO</a>, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</p>\n<p>“It needs to be properly set up, and then you need manpower to monitor it,” he told TechNewsWorld. “And, of course, the question is, what do you do with the information?”</p>\n<p>Grimes agreed. “The average organization just doesn’t have the time to do these types of research activities and, in general, when deception technologies are used, they are used for early warning to quicken incident response and reduce costs and downtime.”</p>\n<p>Some of those manpower concerns could be addressed through the use of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Creating realistic or convincing deceptive environments becomes an ideal task to employ large language model AI, as one needs to be able to populate a number of individual accounts all interacting with each other, with a backlog of historical communication between them for threat actors to search through,” Daniel Blackford, director of threat research at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us\">Proofpoint</a>, an enterprise security company, in Sunnyvale, Calif., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Grimes praised Microsoft and other big organizations for doing the hard work of using deception for research and learning and then using the lessons learned to improve defenses that benefit everyone.</p>\n<p>“As much as I love deception technologies in general, mitigating phishing isn’t the best use case for the average organization,” he added, “but as Microsoft is using it — where they are learning what are the current and latest tools, techniques and tricks — it’s a great tool.”</p>\n<h3>Fighting Phishing</h3>\n<p>While using deception to fight phishing may not be in the cards for every organization, it can be a potent weapon for those who choose to deploy it for that purpose.</p>\n<p>“Deception can be a powerful tool against phishing, utilizing fake assets — like decoy emails, websites or credentials — to mislead attackers into revealing their tactics without compromising real data,” said Shawn Loveland, a cybersecurity expert with <a href=\"https://www.resecurity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Resecurity</a>, a global enterprise and government cybersecurity company.</p>\n<p>“By using these methods, organizations engage phishers in controlled settings, enabling security teams to detect and analyze phishing attempts in real-time,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This diverts threats from genuine targets while collecting intelligence on phishing tactics.”</p>\n<p>“Additionally,” Loveland continued, “simulated phishing campaigns train users and internal monitoring systems to recognize and resist actual attacks, enhancing overall security.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Kowski added that phishing remains a significant threat to organizations as it evolves and adapts to new security measures. “BEC [Business Email Compromise] innovation has waned, and instead, we’ve seen a rise of multi-channel 3D phishing attacks. Threat actors are innovating and exploiting trusted services like OneDrive, Dropbox, and GitHub to deliver malicious emails,” he said. “This shift in tactics makes phishing a persistent and growing concern for organizations.”</p>\n<p>“Phishing is and will continue to be one of the most significant threats individuals and organizations face,” Loveland added. “The new AI-powered phishing tools, combined with personal data available to phishers, will fundamentally change things in the phishers’ favor.”</p>\n<p>For organizations that do use deception to combat phishing attacks, Vincalek gave this advice: “Deception really works best when organizations combine the strategy with other security measures. Businesses shouldn’t rely on deception alone to combat all phishing attacks.”</p>\n<p>Grimes added: “If you use deception technologies, make sure to customize them so that they mimic your real environment. For example, if you use Microsoft Windows primarily in your environment, you want your deception technologies to look like Windows, using the same default services and network ports.”</p>\n<p>“A common mistake new deception technology users make,” he explained, “is to put out deception technologies that don’t appear natural in their environment, advertising the wrong services and ports for what the company really uses.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>When we talk about AI, we typically focus on one metric: productivity. That metric has been used in every technology announcement since the beginning of the current tech age.</p>\n<p>Going back to when I first became an external tech analyst and during the ramp-up to the launch of Windows 95, the argument was that it improved productivity so much that it would provide a return on investment (ROI) within a year of its purchase. It turned out that during the first year, the product broke so much it had an initial negative rather than positive impact on productivity.</p>\n<p>AI’s ROI is potentially far worse, and ironically, much of our problem this century is not the lack of productivity or performance but poor decision support.</p>\n<p>Last week, I attended a Computex prep event. As I watched the presentations, I noticed a familiar undercurrent of productivity. I remain concerned that if we improve speeds significantly but do not also improve the quality of the related decisions, we’ll be making mistakes at machine speeds, which may not be survivable.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about that this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, which is the airline I just took to Taiwan. It was so much better than United, which I usually use for international trips, that I figured I’d point out why so many non-U.S. airlines are significantly better than U.S. carriers.</p>\n<h3>Productivity vs. Quality</h3>\n<p>I am ex-IBM. During my tenure there, I was one of a small group that went through IBM’s executive training program. One of the principles that was driven into all the employees was that quality mattered.</p>\n<p>The most memorable class I took in this regard was not from IBM but from the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP). Its focus was speed vs. direction. The instructor argued that most companies focus on speed first when it comes to new processes and technology.</p>\n<p>He maintained that if you do not focus first on direction, you will end up going in the wrong direction at an ever-faster pace. If you do not first focus on defining the goal, speed will not help you. It will make things worse.</p>\n<p>While at both IBM and Siemens as a competitive analyst, I had the annoying experience of providing decision support and having our recommendations not only ignored but actively fought and then not followed. It resulted in catastrophic losses and the failure of several groups I worked for.</p>\n<p>The reason was that executives would rather appear to be right than actually be right. After a time, my unit was disbanded (a trend that cut across the industry) because executives didn’t like the embarrassment of being called on the carpet after a catastrophic failure for ignoring well-founded advice because their “gut” told them their predetermined direction must be better, yet repeatedly wasn’t.</p>\n<p>After I stopped working inside companies and became an external analyst, I was amazed to find that my advice was more likely to be followed because executives didn’t feel my being right created a threat to their careers.</p>\n<p>From inside the company, they considered me a risk. From outside, I wasn’t, so they were more willing to listen and follow a different strategy because they didn’t feel like they were competing with me.</p>\n<p>Executives have access to massive amounts of data that should enable them to make better decisions. However, I still see too many who make poorly founded decisions that result in catastrophic outcomes.</p>\n<p>Therefore, AI should be focused on helping companies make better decisions, and only then should it be focused on productivity and performance. If you focus on speed without ensuring the decision behind the direction is the right one, you are more likely to go in the wrong direction much faster, resulting in both more frequent and more expensive mistakes.</p>\n<h3>Decision-Making Challenges</h3>\n<p>From our personal to our professional lives, we can make decisions faster with AI, but the quality of those decisions is degrading. If you were to look back at Microsoft and Intel, two of the principal backers of the current AI technology wave, you would see that for much of their existence, particularly this century, the firms made bad decisions that cost them both one or more CEOs.</p>\n<p>My old friend Steve Ballmer was cursed by bad decision after bad decision, which I still think was as much the result of the people or person supporting him rather than anything inherent to the man himself.</p>\n<p>The guy was top of his class at Harvard and arguably the smartest person I’ve ever met. He is credited with the success of the Xbox. Still, after that, despite husbanding Microsoft’s financial performance well, he failed with the Zune, Microsoft Phone, and Yahoo, crippling Microsoft’s valuation and resulting in his being fired.</p>\n<p>Along with a few other analysts, I was initially assigned to help him make better decisions. However, we were all sidelined almost immediately, even though I authored email after email, arguing that if he did not improve the quality of his decisions, he was going to get fired. Sadly, he just got angry with my attempts. I still think of his failure as my own, and it will haunt me for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>This problem mirrors what happened to John Akers at IBM, who was surrounded by people who did not let in information from those of us closer to problems. While my efforts in IBM to eliminate the problems in that company were rewarded, the impact of people like me, and there were a lot, were so downgraded that Akers lost his job. It was not because he was stupid or didn’t listen. It was because we were blocked by executives who had his ear and didn’t want to lose the status connected with that access.</p>\n<p>Thus, the information that both company CEOs needed to be successful was denied by people they trusted. They were more focused on status and access than on assuring the success of the companies they worked for.</p>\n<h3>The AI Decision Problem Is Two-Fold</h3>\n<p>First, we know that the results from AI efforts, while impressive in capability, are also incredibly inaccurate or incomplete. The Wall Street Journal just <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-perplexity-claude-f9e40d26\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evaluated</a> the top AI products and found that both Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot were, with some exceptions, the lowest quality, even though they should be the most widely used.</p>\n<p>In addition, as I pointed out above, even if they were far more accurate, given past behavior, executives might not use them, preferring their gut to anything a system told them. Although this may reduce the impact of the quality issues with these products, the result is a system that either cannot or will not be trusted.</p>\n<p>The current quality issues help support and reinforce the bad behavior that existed prior to the current generation of AI, so even if the quality problems with AI are corrected, it will still underperform its potential to make businesses and governments more successful.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Right now, our need for speed (productivity, performance) is far less than our need for the technology providing this benefit to be both trustworthy and worthy of trust. But even if we were to fix this problem, <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/hugo_mercier-the-argumentative-theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Argumentative Theory</a> suggests that the technology will not be used for better decision support due to our general inability to see internal advice as anything but a threat to our jobs, status, and image.</p>\n<p>There is some truth to this position because if people know your decisions are based on AI advice, might they eventually conclude that you are redundant?</p>\n<p>We need to stop focusing on AI with productivity as a primary goal and focus instead on far higher quality and providing better decision support so that we are not overwhelmed with bad decisions and advice at machine speeds.</p>\n<p>Then, we need to actively train people to accept valid advice, which will more effectively allow us to advance at machine speeds rather than be buried by bad decisions at that same speed. We also need to reward people for their effective use of AI, not make them feel that this use will put their jobs and careers at risk.</p>\n<p>AI can help make a better world, but only if it provides quality results and we use those results to make our decisions.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Starlux Airlines</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Starlux-Airlines.jpg\" alt=\"Starlux Airlines\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Starlux-Airlines.jpg 750w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Starlux-Airlines-300x120.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></p>\n<p>I’ve nearly stopped flying on United Airlines due to bad experiences that have ranged from being stuck in remote airports due to canceled flights to paying for first-class tickets only to end up in coach because of a combination of bad operations and an unwillingness to assure the passengers delayed due to operations mistakes that they make it to their destinations timely.</p>\n<p>My experience with non-U.S. carriers has been far better. On my trip to Computex last week, I took <a href=\"https://www.starlux-airlines.com/en-TW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starlux</a>, a Taiwanese carrier. The experience on this airline was far superior.</p>\n<p>In business class on United, I often feel like less of a customer and more of an annoyance. On Starlux, people went out of their way to make sure my trip was comfortable; they took my personal care as a priority. When I asked for a special meal, they went out of their way to supply it. When I struggled with the Wi-Fi, they gave me support until the problem was resolved and seemed to care about ensuring my experience was exemplary.</p>\n<p>I travel a lot in my career and dread it, which is sad because when I was a kid, I looked forward to every time I flew on an airplane. When I traveled on Starlux, I regained some of that love for flying and found I was looking forward to the flight home rather than dreading getting on the plane.</p>\n<p>Starlux made my 13-hour flight fun, and I should point out that I’ve noticed this with other foreign carriers, like Singapore Airlines, Emirates Airlines, and others on <a href=\"https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-top-10-airlines-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this list</a>. So, Starlux Airlines is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>One of the largest ransomware payouts that’s become public was reported Tuesday by cloud security firm <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zscaler</a>.</p>\n<p>The US$75 million payment made to the Dark Angels ransomware group was discovered by Zscaler’s security research arm ThreatLabz earlier this year, according to the company’s annual ransomware report, which covers a period from April 2023 to April 2024.</p>\n<p>Zscaler did not disclose the name of the company that paid the ransom.</p>\n<p>“Dark Angels operates differently than most other ransomware groups,” observed Zscaler’s Director of Threat Intelligence Brett Stone-Gross.</p>\n<p>“Instead of outsourcing attacks to affiliates, they’re launching the attacks and doing it at a much smaller scale,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Instead of targeting dozens or hundreds of companies, they’re going after very large companies one at a time.”</p>\n<p>The group also departs from the modus operandi of most of its peers in another way. “They steal a large amount of data, but they want to avoid business disruption,” Stone-Gross said. “They want to stay out of the headlines because it reduces the amount of scrutiny they will get from law enforcement and researchers.”</p>\n<p>The Dark Angels ransomware group’s strategy of targeting a small number of high-value companies for large payouts is a trend worth monitoring, the report noted.</p>\n<p>Zscaler ThreatLabz predicted that other ransomware groups will take note of Dark Angels’ success and may adopt similar tactics. To maximize their financial gains, they will focus on high-value targets and increase the significance of data theft.</p>\n<p>Data theft has already become part of the game plan of many ransomware actors, added Steve Stone, head of Zero Labs at <a href=\"https://www.rubrik.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rubrik</a>, a global data security and backup software company. “Ransomware actors aren’t just encrypting environments and asking for a ransom,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They’re doing that and stealing data so they can make an extortion demand. It’s effectively a double ransom.”</p>\n<h3>Growing Menace</h3>\n<p>Zscaler also reported that the number of ransomware attacks blocked by its cloud increased by 17.8% during the reporting period, and the number of extorted companies on data leak sites grew by 57.8% in the same period, despite numerous law enforcement operations, including the seizure of infrastructure, arrests, criminal indictments, and sanctions.</p>\n<p>Chris Morales, CISO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.netenrich.com/\">Netenrich</a>, a security operations center services provider in San Jose, Calif., identified several factors contributing to the growth of ransomware. They include expanded attack surfaces due to remote work and cloud adoption, more sophisticated ransomware attacks often involving data exfiltration and the democratization of attack tools through ransomware-as-a-service.</p>\n<p>“We’re also seeing larger-scale breaches affecting millions of users at once,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This surge not only highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift in security operations, but it also underscores the need for immediate action, moving towards more proactive, data-driven strategies.”</p>\n<p>“We expect breaches and ransomware attacks to continue increasing in the second half of 2024, especially targeting healthcare, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and supply chains,” added Stephen Kowski, field CTO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a computer and network security company in Pleasanton, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Recent high-profile incidents, such as the health care and car dealership vendor hacks, highlight the ongoing vulnerabilities,” he told TechNewsWorld. “To combat this, organizations need to focus on strengthening email security, implementing zero-trust architectures, and improving threat detection and response capabilities.”</p>\n<h3>Top Sector Targets</h3>\n<p>Manufacturing, health care, and technology were the top sectors targeted by ransomware attacks, according to the report, while the energy sector experienced a 500% year-over-year spike as critical infrastructure and susceptibility to operational disruptions make it particularly attractive to cybercriminals.</p>\n<p>Among the top targets for cyber extortion, manufacturing led the pack. It was targeted more than twice as much as any other industry.</p>\n<p>“Many manufacturing organizations have been around for a long time, and there’s a lot of legacy habits that do not serve them well when it comes to ransomware,” noted Stone of Zero Labs.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Marcus Fowler, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://darktrace.com\">Darktrace</a> Federal, a global cybersecurity AI company, explained that critical infrastructure providers and manufacturing companies are increasingly pursuing information technology and operational technology convergence as the data collection and analysis benefits can dramatically improve production efficiency, maintenance, and scaling.</p>\n<p>“With IT/OT convergence expanding attack surfaces, security personnel have increased workloads that make it difficult to keep pace with threats and vulnerabilities,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The manufacturing industry has been undergoing significant digitization in order to become more agile and efficient,” added Rogier Fischer, CEO of <a href=\"https://hadrian.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hadrian</a>, the maker of an automated, event-based scanning solution in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>“The downside is that processes that were effectively air-gapped are now connected to corporate IT systems,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The interconnectivity of OT and IT environments, along with the historically less cyber-aware manufacturing industry, makes the sector an attractive target.”</p>\n<h3>Need for Zero Trust</h3>\n<p>Zscaler’s Chief Security Officer Deepen Desai maintains that ransomware defense remains a top priority for CISOs in 2024. “The increasing use of ransomware-as-a-service models, along with numerous zero-day attacks on legacy systems, a rise in vishing attacks, and the emergence of AI-powered attacks, has led to record-breaking ransom payments,” he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Organizations must prioritize zero trust architecture to strengthen their security posture against ransomware attacks,” Desai added.</p>\n<p>Fischer noted that zero trust is part of a mindset shift. “It’s going from the reactive ‘how can I detect an attack underway’ or ‘how can I respond to an incident’ to a proactive ‘how can I keep bad actors out.’ Zero trust and offensive security principles help organizations mitigate cyber risk proactively.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Cybersecurity prioritization and investment before a cybercriminal strike is critical for organizations of all sizes, added Anne Cutler, a cybersecurity evangelist at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“A zero-trust security model with least privileged access and strong data backups will limit the blast radius if a cyberattack occurs,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Additionally, strong identity and access management on the front end will help prevent the most common cyberattacks that can lead to a disastrous data breach.”</p>\n<p>However, Steve Hahn, executive vice president for the Americas of <a href=\"https://bullwall.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BullWall</a>, a provider of ransomware containment, protection, and mitigation solutions in Denmark, cautioned that while zero trust will certainly lessen the chances of an attack, the journey is typically very long for customers and still not a silver bullet.</p>\n<p>“Zero-day attacks, shadow IT, personal devices, IoT devices, these are all attack vectors for ransomware,” he told TechNewsWorld, “and once the encryption begins at the shared drives, whether those are cloud or local, it’s only a matter of time before all of the data is encrypted, even with zero-trust network architecture in place.”</p>\n",

About a dozen years ago, pink slime referred to outlets that surreptitiously used low-paid labor from distant locales, even the Philippines. Now they’re being produced by AI.”</p>\n<h3>Blue and Red Slime</h3>\n<p>Pink slime sites pose multiple risks to communities, observed NewsGuard Senior Analyst Chiara Vercellone. “They can confuse readers about what sources are trustworthy, thereby undermining the credibility of genuine local news outlets,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“By pushing their specific political agendas,” she continued, “they can polarize community opinions and influence voting behavior, oftentimes without the readers fully realizing the source’s bias.”</p>\n<p>Vercellone cited a 2023 Courier Newsroom study that found individuals who had been subscribers to its newsletters for longer than eight months were the most likely to change their minds in terms of supporting candidates. The same study stated that recipients of the Courier’s political newsletters increased their support for Democratic candidates by five percentage points.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The NewsGuard report noted that the partisan websites masquerading as local news outlets comprised groups on the left and the right, including Metric Media, Local Government Information Services, Courier Newsroom, The American Independent, and States Newsroom. It added that these networks receive low ratings from NewsGuard for failing to adhere to basic journalistic standards.</p>\n<p>Kennedy maintained that NewsGuard is stretching the definition of pink slime to cover projects that produce reliable news and information but may have some undisclosed partisan funding. “It calls States Newsroom a pink slime project, for instance, which seems like a stretch,” he said. “Maybe States Newsroom should be more transparent, but that doesn’t mean it produces nothing of value.”</p>\n<h3>Partisanship Everywhere</h3>\n<p><a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://emerson.edu/faculty-staff-directory/vincent-raynauld\">Vincent Raynauld</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Emerson College in Boston, maintained pink slime websites take a partisan approach to delivering the news.</p>\n<p>“Partisanship is becoming an increasingly big component of how people behave politically and in their personal life,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are dating websites where your political identity is becoming a key component of how people introduce themselves. Pink slime builds on that dynamic to make a quick buck.”</p>\n<p>“Pink slime is more than just fake news — it’s the first step in fostering a mistrust in news organizations, which can foster a low-trust society,” added <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessawalilko/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vanessa Walilko</a>, an independent scholar in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“Low-trust societies are more susceptible to fascist takeover,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>While fake news isn’t great, it isn’t a grave threat to our society, contended David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“There has always been and will always be fake or bad news,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We should remember that while the internet allowed these pink slime sites to emerge, it has also enabled countless other Americans to become citizen journalists.”</p>\n<p>“While some may wax nostalgic when they think of the media of 1990, we should keep in mind that back then, if the media didn’t want to cover issues that were important to you or didn’t frame your viewpoints in a fair light, you might not have many other local options,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Now we have so many ways to access, share, and create useful information online across a wide range of perspectives,” he continued. “The challenge we face is being good and critical consumers of this dramatic increase in information available to us.”</p>\n<h3>Slime Spurt Expected</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://today.usc.edu/profile/mark-marino/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark Marino</a>, director of the Humanities and Critical Code Studies Lab at the University of Southern California, found the numbers in the NewsGuard report troublesome. “It’s disturbing where we are now, since it doesn’t account for the full transition to what will happen when more people harness ChatGPT and other LLMs to create content sites,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>What’s more, another spurt in slime sites can be expected as the nation approaches November. “In previous election years, we saw the presence of pink slime networks increase, and new sites appear,” Vercellone said. “For example, ahead of the 2022 U.S. midterms, NewsGuard discovered a new network of five news websites in battleground states that pushed a steady stream of left-leaning partisan content aimed at influencing potential voters.”</p>\n<p>“The average voter is going to have a much harder time this year sorting things out and will have to wade through increasingly more slime,” predicted Marino.</p>\n<p>Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a news, commentary, and analysis website, agreed. “The decline of local news has contributed to political polarization,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Unfortunately, I’m not very optimistic about the situation.”</p>\n<p>“The big tech platforms seem to be ambivalent at best about trying to prevent disinformation and only committed to occasional enforcement,” he continued. “Foreign adversaries clearly recognize an opportunity to destabilize the U.S. and influence elections.”</p>\n<p>“I think the onslaught will only get worse as we approach November,” he added. “And many Americans, prone to accepting conspiracies, don’t seem to be savvy enough to distinguish real from fake news.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>With the advent of AI and rapidly changing corporate needs and performance, many companies have announced layoffs this year, and I expect we are far from done. These layoffs range in size from small, like eBay’s announcement of 1,000 layoffs, to the much larger 12,000-plus layoffs expected from Dell and Intel, among others.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the size of the layoff, employees face difficult and unexpected choices. Making the wrong decision could not only end your career but also lead to legal trouble if you act impulsively without considering the risks.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss layoffs this week, and I’ll close with my Product of the Week: a new head-mounted display from Goovis that could be useful for those of us who watch TV in bed and aren’t quite ready to quit when our spouses want to call it a night.</p>\n<h3>The Art of Conducting Layoffs</h3>\n<p>There is an art to layoffs of which most companies seem unaware.</p>\n<p>The first big layoff I experienced was at IBM under Louis Gerstner. What made it better than most was that the employees who were to be laid off were called to a meeting. While at the meeting, their personal effects were gathered and sent to a remote office facility where they had three months to find another job either inside IBM or outside. During that time, they continued to receive full salaries and benefits. Their only job for that period of time was to find new employment, and most did.</p>\n<p>That approach helped eliminate some typical problems with layoffs, including employees acting out, the low morale associated with blending people whose jobs were safe with those being asked to leave, and helping assure the employees who were laid off didn’t subsequently act out against IBM.</p>\n<p>This last is important when you consider that, a few years later, another computer company didn’t do this. One of the terminated employees ended up as a buyer for that firm’s largest retail channel and terminated the contract, effectively forcing the firm to be sold to a competitor due to lost revenue.</p>\n<p>Under CEO Carley Fiorina, HP handled a layoff very poorly. It didn’t take care of the laid-off employees well. During the layoff, it bought new corporate jets and publicly increased Fiorina’s compensation, which really upset not only those who were laid off but also the remaining employees.</p>\n<p>Fiorina later ran for office in California and lost by the number of people she’d laid off and their immediate families, suggesting she paid dearly for mistreating her people.</p>\n<p>How a company executes a layoff tells you much about what executive management thinks of its employees. Companies with CEOs who handle layoffs poorly should be avoided, as these leaders tend to prioritize their own compensation over the well-being of employees, stockholders, and customers. Poorly executed layoffs put all three at risk.</p>\n<h3>Employee Choices When Laid-Off</h3>\n<p>Laid-off employees must make choices, some of which are problematic. An unfortunate number of employees will choose to act out with behavior ranging from badmouthing their firm, stealing company property, or, in one case, where a CIO was laid off, erasing the firm’s databases (he went to jail).</p>\n<p>Some terminated employees resort to violence, which is never acceptable. The worst case of this was the <a href=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/02/bora-f24.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1974 Borax layoff and strike</a> where the local town and company went to war. Helicopters were shot down, managers were buried up to their necks in ant hills, and ex-military personnel were hired to fight off the angry, terminated employees.</p>\n<p>I was briefed by one of the ex-Ranger security teams, and it sounded like a war zone, showcasing that things can go very badly when you piss off a lot of folks. Fortunately, this is rare, but when it does happen, it can be catastrophic. That scenario was part of my training, and the stories were truly frightening.</p>\n<p>What employees need to remember is that you can make things worse. Acting out, especially with violence, can lead to legal jeopardy and render you unemployable. That behavior won’t hurt the employer so much as it will hurt you and those close to you.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>It is easier to find a new job before you are laid off than after because you avoid the questions about why you were terminated, which, depending on your answer and whether the interviewer believes you, could get you cut from consideration for that new job.</p>\n<p>Too often, those left behind in a layoff think those who were cut were the lucky ones because most firms don’t compensate the remaining employees for the extra work they have to perform. Layoffs also tend to come in waves when done poorly because of unintended consequences, and collateral damage can negatively impact sales, customer loyalty, and the company’s ability to execute.</p>\n<p>So, you need to consider if you are up to this drama and excessive workload.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the company does dig out, there will be opportunities that wouldn’t have otherwise existed. If you have put in the work and management is aware, you should be on the shortlist to benefit from those opportunities.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t good at tooting your own horn by making people aware of the effort as a result of you making that big push, then you won’t benefit and should consider leaving instead. However, slacking will result in your being on the shortlist for the next layoff, so that is an ill-advised path to take.</p>\n<p>The only time to seek a different job within the same company after a layoff is if your department is being eliminated and you still enjoy working there. If laid off for performance reasons, that stigma will follow you, making it harder to secure the next job and potentially putting you at risk for future layoffs. So, moving to another company might be strategically in your best interest.</p>\n<p>Finally, I recommend avoiding companies that have had multiple layoffs over a five-year period. Such a record indicates endemic problems that may be unfixable. No one wants to go through a layoff once, let alone multiple times.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Layoffs are unfortunate, and well-run companies don’t do them as there are better ways to reduce costs that aren’t as risky. It is sad that the art of downsizing an employee base has degraded as much as it has, and the advent of AI is expected to result in much more significant workforce reductions in the future.</p>\n<p>I recommend upskilling when possible and perhaps developing a second area of expertise in case an AI solution embraces your career path.</p>\n<p>My best advice is that if you are angry or have poor impulse control, take a few days off to think about your options and craft a safe path forward as you learn from the experience.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> After being laid off, I know people who have gotten rid of all of their expensive things, gotten a relatively low-paying, low-stress, and more fun job, and found the change to result in a far better life. Being laid off gives you the option of changing your life for the better, something more of us should regularly do since a lot of people don’t enjoy their current career path.</p>\n<p>Finally, like everything else, this too shall pass if you don’t do anything stupid and instead use it as an opportunity to find a better job and a better life. Oh, and one thing you definitely don’t want to do is take your anger home to your friends, kids, or spouse. That never ends well.</p>\n<p>Best of luck, and for those being laid off, my heart goes out to you. I hope you end up in a better place.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The Goovis Art</h3>\n<p>I’ve been buying Goovis headsets for years and have one of everything they’ve made so far.</p>\n<p>I also have Rokid headsets, with the difference typically being that the <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/standout-tech-products-of-2023-178853.html#rokid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rokid devices look more like glasses</a>, and you can use them to work confidentially (no one but you can see the screen) and still see your hands on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Goovis products isolate you more, making them better for watching videos or playing video games that use controllers, where you don’t need to reposition your fingers on the keyboard or use keyboard binds.</p>\n<p>The Goovis Art is a blend of the old Goovis headsets and the Rokid approach in that it has the same high-quality experience as other Goovis products, but it doesn’t seal against your face, so you can still see your hands and use it as a head-mounted display for work.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Goovis Art | Hanging Design Head-Mounted Display\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ST38Z_Xptc\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The display also flips up so you can more easily disengage if someone walks up or you need to see what that strange noise was that wasn’t part of the game or movie.

She is happy, so I am happy, and I can even do email or social media, assuming I’m using a laptop with a non-mechanical keyboard (tablets don’t work well because finger placement on a virtual keyboard is problematic in the dark).</p>\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/art-extended-3d-viewer-for-multi-tasking#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goovis Art is on Indiegogo</a> at a 37% discount and immediate shipping (it takes around a week to get it out of China), putting it at $440 + shipping, taxes, and accessories. They offer a case and streaming box that I bought, but I only use them when my phone doesn’t support an external monitor for movies. The eventual list price will be $699, making it a decent deal to get early.</p>\n<p>Goovis has always done impressive work, and since Goovis Art makes it so I can doom scroll YouTube without facing spousal revenge, it is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The AI PC market moved quickly after the first generation of limited AI PCs hit the market a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Microsoft and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite kicked off the second generation. While those products were impressive, they didn’t address three key markets: workstation-class machines, gaming PCs, or PCs for professional creators. They were fine for most of us but weren’t performant for the people who build, create, and play the most powerful games or the software and hardware engineers who are building AI solutions.</p>\n<p>Well, with one noted exception. AMD just announced it will close that gap with a class of PCs that have the graphics and processor performance demanded by creators.</p>\n<p>These are machines with discrete graphics cards and the power to meet the needs of those who demand the highest performance yet still want all the advantages that AI brings without cratering battery life. The still missing link is desktop PCs, but they are waiting for Microsoft to enable them. The problem isn’t the hardware, as much as Microsoft’s unfortunate decision not to support them yet.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss AMD’s approach to addressing these market gaps. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, the Asus ProArt Studiobook 16, which caught my lustful eye at the AMD event.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft’s Flawed AI PC Copilot+ Launch</h3>\n<p>Whenever a new platform emerges, like AI now, the initial problem is a lack of applications.</p>\n<p>Microsoft targeted its AI PC launch on users with two new applications: Recall and Cocreator. Microsoft should have focused first on developers. As Steve Ballmer once said, “Developers, developers, developers.”</p>\n<p>However, the initial product Microsoft brought to market was focused on users, not developers. Microsoft seemed to go out of its way to ignore developers by neglecting workstation-class laptops, which have GPUs, and all desktops. Many of us who work on PCs for a living prefer desktops for their sheer power.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Not only did this reduce the capabilities of those building for AI, but Recall was so poorly presented that even though it kept the data it collected safely on the PC from which it was collected — which is unusual given that Microsoft is one of the leading cloud vendors — people believed it was a security risk, so Microsoft was forced to pull it back.</p>\n<p>The really annoying thing is that there was no Copilot+ solution for performance PCs and workstations, even though high-end discrete GPUs easily outperform NPUs and are already in the market. Even more unbelievable, Nvidia’s GPU technology was used to create the generative AI that Microsoft uses, OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n<h3>AMD to the Rescue</h3>\n<p>AMD’s launch addresses this shortcoming. What’s fascinating is that most of the laptops that were announced with Nvidia graphics cards and an NPU at 50 TOPS closed the gap that Microsoft unfortunately created.</p>\n<p>These are impressive laptops. Most were powerhouses but still promised all-day battery life and around a four-pound carry weight, making them impressively light and long-lasting for their class. Asus had the strongest line, many with 16-inch displays and several with 4K OLED displays with high color accuracy, which is ideal for gaming, image work, and performance in line with portable workstations.</p>\n<p>It is a shame AMD didn’t include an NPU in a desktop configuration. That would have put them above the crowd. However, given that Microsoft would just need to enable desktop GPUs, I understand why it didn’t. Still, it would have made for an incredibly sustainable configuration, given digital assistants need to run nearly constantly.</p>\n<p>While desktops and workstations don’t need battery life, they consume a ton of power. Using an NPU instead of a high-performance GPU would make for an interesting, low-power alternative.</p>\n<p>This approach is generally a good competitive practice, particularly in an emerging market. Rather than directly engaging first-to-market competitors, target areas where they aren’t and where they have a performance disadvantage. That’s what AMD is doing here.</p>\n<h3>The Silo AI Twist</h3>\n<p>During the event, AMD announced it would purchase a uniquely important company, <a href=\"https://www.silo.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Silo AI</a>, the largest private AI lab in Europe. Right now, few people know how to deploy AI solutions successfully, and most AI deployments are failing. Silo AI, in contrast, has successfully deployed AI in over 200 accounts, and in a market that is short of AI talent, they have 125 highly skilled AI professionals (PhDs).</p>\n<p>The Silo AI acquisition will supply AMD with two critical advantages.</p>\n<p>First, it will allow them to help their end-user customers successfully deploy AI with AMD’s technology in the back office. Second, it will provide AMD with invaluable information on where current technologies are failing, both on servers and desktops, allowing AMD to focus better on its development efforts going forward.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>While Nvidia is currently the king of AI, one disadvantage in being first is that you don’t have anyone to follow, and when blazing a trail, you can drift off track.</p>\n<p>AMD is behind, but with Silo AI, they can see any mistake that Nvidia might make and attempt to capitalize on it. While it is unlikely AMD will be able to pass Nvidia this way, it could become the strongest number two in a market that is far from saturated.</p>\n<p>As a result, AMD probably won’t gain at Nvidia’s expense but speed overall AI adaptation. A stronger competitor should also help Nvidia focus, so this has the potential to benefit both companies.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>AMD’s coming offerings are impressive, particularly since they close a major critical part of the gap Microsoft created by focusing on users before focusing on developers.</p>\n<p>The result should be faster app development for AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm NPUs. At least initially, there are no real losers here because we all benefit from better and more successful AI deployments and a richer application ecosystem.</p>\n<p>All in all, the AMD folks have made incredible progress. I expect AMD CEO Lisa Su is incredibly proud of the work these people have done to make this happen.</p>\n<p>Overall, very nicely done.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Asus ProArt P16 Laptop</h3>\n<p>If it is possible to fall in love with a laptop, I fell in love with the <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-creators/proart/proart-p16-h7606/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asus ProArt P16</a>. This laptop is amazing. It is just 14.9mm thin, weighs only 1.85 kg, and features a stunning Lumina 4K OLED screen.

This is a nice-looking laptop, and while I wasn’t given final pricing, I expect it to be surprisingly affordable for this level of performance. The ProArt P16 is a full <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-copilot-pcs-arrive-my-initial-impressions-179245.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copilot+ PC</a>, so it has that new XDNA2 NPU that is currently the most powerful in the market. Coupled with the Nvidia GPU, this makes it a literal AI powerhouse.</p>\n<p>While Asus targeted this product at animators, photographers, and videographers, it would make for one heck of a gaming laptop — and when we finally get those games with AI non-player characters (NPCs), it’ll have the power to run them where other laptops, even AI PC laptops, won’t.</p>\n<p>Of all the announced PCs, this was by far my favorite, making the Asus ProArt P16 AI PC my product of the week. It defines awesome and sets the bar for what an AMD/Nvidia performant AI PC should be.</p>\n",

The interconnected nature of IoT devices means that their benefits are not just additive but multiplicative.</p>\n<p>As more devices come online and begin to communicate with each other, the possibilities for innovation expand exponentially. This network effect makes it challenging to predict how IoT will transform industries and daily life.</p>\n<h3>Infineon Bets on the ‘Edge’ To Optimize IoT’s Business Potential</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infineon Technologies</a> is one of the leading global semiconductor manufacturers specializing in microelectronics. The company provides innovative solutions for automotive, industrial, and consumer markets, focusing on energy efficiency, mobility, and security.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>While its capabilities can be broadly applied to multiple markets, its next-generation PSOC (programmable system-on-chip) Edge portfolio, which features powerful AI capabilities for consumer and industrial applications in the IoT space, is perhaps the poster child for overall industry optimism.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers integrate configurable digital and analog circuits into PSOC devices. These devices offer improved design revision capability and reduced component count because an on-chip microprocessor manages them. They are efficient, take up less board space, use less power and lower system costs. These attributes appeal broadly to IoT device makers as win-win elements.</p>\n<h3>AI Takes These Capabilities to a Higher Level</h3>\n<p>Increasingly, next-generation IoT edge devices require more performance without sacrificing power. Because <a href=\"https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/market-news/2024/INFCSS202404-086.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infineon’s new PSOC solutions</a> use machine language (ML) capabilities to compute alertness while balancing performance and providing integrated security for connected home devices, wearables, and numerous industrial applications, AI becomes a significant benefit.</p>\n<p>AI enhances voice/audio sensing for activation and control, vision-based position detection, and face/object detection. As a result, IoT devices can become more intuitive, anticipative, less reactionary, and proactive in their operation.</p>\n<p>Examples of these enhancements are security system cameras that can discern with a high degree of confidence between external intruders and animals or HVAC systems that can avoid costly repairs by proactively signaling device failures weeks or months in advance.</p>\n<p>In my recent interview with Infineon’s EVP of IoT, Compute, and Wireless, Sam Geha said AI will make legacy IoT devices look crude and archaic. “As billions more IoT devices are deployed into the market, more information must be stored, processed, and harnessed. AI will help connect our real world to the digital world, from buildings and homes to wearable consumer and fitness devices to factories and cities,” Geha remarked.</p>\n<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>\n<p>To be sure, Infineon’s involvement in the IoT space was strong before “internet of things” became a buzzphrase.</p>\n<p>The company’s IoT strategy enables secure, energy-efficient, intelligent, connected devices by leveraging its expertise in microelectronics to provide comprehensive solutions, including sensors, microcontrollers, and connectivity modules.</p>\n<p>Infineon prioritizes robust security features to protect data and privacy in IoT applications. Its approach emphasizes seamless integration and interoperability, supporting diverse applications from smart homes to industrial automation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Infineon has a strong “design-in” confidence reputation that puts OEMs at ease, a significant advantage given that these solutions are being integrated into solutions that can cost $60,000 or more, as is the case with EVs.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Geha also believes that a microcontroller approach like Infineon’s new PSOC Edge E84 family is the most cost-effective way to democratize these solutions in a broad spectrum of products that use AI and ML in wearables, smart homes and other low-power “always-on domain” products with autonomous analog sensing supporting battery applications, such as smart locks, video doorbells, and security cameras.</p>\n<p>“Infineon’s vision is to create capabilities in this space that can scale, make it easy for design partners to utilize its solutions over multiple generations of products, and get faster to market in a consistent and reliable manner,” Geha stated.</p>\n<p>The IoT market is projected to grow significantly, with an estimated value of over $1 trillion by 2025. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of IoT devices across various industries, including health care, manufacturing, and smart cities. Over the next five years, analysts expect the market to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 25%, highlighting its rapid expansion and transformative potential. These are not trivial data points.</p>\n<p>While the overall market seems obsessed with how the likes of Apple and Google are battling over AI and its comprehension in their smartphone, PC, and tablet operating systems, Infineon has quietly played a leadership role in putting the pieces in place to optimize AI at the edge in the IoT space.</p>\n<p>While it may not always get the headlines it deserves, Infineon continues to quietly demonstrate IoT market governance, innovation, and credibility, which few companies have achieved.</p>\n",

I got a gorgeous HP EliteBook Ultra 14 and the Microsoft Surface Laptop, 7th Edition, both of which have just started shipping.</p>\n<p>While these are nearly identical in size and weight, the HP EliteBook targets enterprise buyers and offers features like Wolf Security, which this user class highly values. Microsoft targets the Surface Laptop at people who would otherwise buy Apple.</p>\n<p>These products outperform their Apple alternatives, though neither HP nor Microsoft has the level of smartphone integration or smartphone commonality that Apple users have come to expect and value.</p>\n<p>Although Microsoft and HP are capable of building better hardware than Apple, neither has stepped up even to try to provide a better solution, making these Apple comparisons pointless.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about Copilot+ PCs this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, the best new electric car on the market.</p>\n<h3>HP EliteBook Ultra 14</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-ultra-14-inch-g1q-notebook-ai-pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP EliteBook Ultra 14</a> is a pretty piece of work. It comes in Dragonfly Blue, my favorite color for a laptop until someone makes a purple one. HP once made my favorite notebook of all time, the old Qualcomm-powered <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/laptops/business/elite-folio.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Folio</a>, which would have been the perfect configuration for one of these new Copilot+ PCs. Fortunately, my second favorite was the old Dragonfly notebook in the same color as this EliteBook.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/HP-EliteBook-Ultra-14.jpg\" alt=\"HP EliteBook Ultra 14, Copilot+ PC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/HP-EliteBook-Ultra-14.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/HP-EliteBook-Ultra-14-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/HP-EliteBook-Ultra-14-768x476.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>EliteBook Ultra 14 | Image Credit: HP</p>\n<p>With 28 hours of video playback and a carry weight of just under three pounds, this notebook is an impressive product. It comes with 16GB of memory, a 512GB hard drive, a decent display with 300 nits of brightness (indoor only), and a price just shy of $1,700.</p>\n<p>Its standout feature is the newest Wolf Security anti-malware software, which employs AI to better identify and mitigate threats. This unique solution is currently unmatched in the market. With attacks from hostile nation-states like Russia, China, and North Korea still spreading and focused on those in large companies with valuable privileges the bad guys want to steal, this level of security is critical for a business-focused laptop.</p>\n<p>The EliteBook Ultra sports two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and a headphone jack. The power supply is a small USB-C unit that uses one of those USB-C ports while in use. This notebook supports the Wi-Fi 6E standard.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft Surface Laptop, 7th Edition</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-laptop-7th-edition/8tq2hq5xxkj9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Surface Laptop, 7th Edition</a> is also pretty. It comes in four colors: sapphire, dune, platinum, and the one they sent me in black. I like the black the best.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/surface-7th-edition.jpg\" alt=\"Surface  Laptop, 7th Edition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/surface-7th-edition.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/surface-7th-edition-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/surface-7th-edition-768x430.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Surface Laptop, 7th Edition | Image Credit: Microsoft</p>\n<p>The Surface Laptop uses the unique PixelSense display, which has the perfect aspect ratio for Windows, a unique advantage that still seems to apply only to Microsoft’s offerings. It has around 400+ nits, which means it works a little better outdoors but is still a bit short of ideal for that use. While it starts at just under $1,000, when configured similarly to the HP EliteBook, the price jumps to just under $1,400.</p>\n<p>This Surface Laptop has dimensions and weight identical to HP’s EliteBook, and it still represents my favorite Surface configuration, even though the Surface Pro is the more performant product due to its WAN option. Given both products use Qualcomm solutions, this should be part of every one of these configurations since WAN modems are where Qualcomm has traditionally excelled.</p>\n<p>The more powerful screen contributes to the Surface Laptop having less video viewing battery life, but it is still an impressive 20 hours.</p>\n<p>One of the key differentiators of the Surface Laptop is its power supply. Unlike many other laptops, it doesn’t take up a USB-C slot, allowing you to use both USB-C ports freely. Additionally, it has a USB-A port and a headphone jack. The power supply is designed to easily disconnect if someone trips over the cord, protecting the device from damage. Anyone working from home with kids or pets should require this feature on a laptop.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/microsoft-trade-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online trade-in program</a> currently offers up to $600, making this an even better value if you have an old laptop that needs to be retired.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>I prefer the appearance, battery life, and security features of the HP EliteBook Ultra, but I favor the display, power supply, and price (especially with the trade-in) of the Surface Laptop, 7th Edition. Both represent my favorite products currently shipping from their respective companies. They are impressively engineered and built.</p>\n<p>Though my ideal product would still be one of those that used the old HP Folio configuration, I’d be more than pleased to carry either. The EliteBook Ultra 14 and Surface Laptop, 7th Edition represent only the first wave of AI-enabled laptops.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>I expect future versions to move farther away from existing standards as they begin to truly embrace what a conversational PC interface can become, which might render the keyboard and touchpad obsolete over time.</p>\n<p>In addition, over the next year, more apps will come out supporting the NPU in both of these products, making them even more compelling offerings.

If it’s possible to fall in love with a car, I’m in love with this one. The vehicle underwent an extraordinarily minor change between 2021 when it first became available, and 2024, which makes my 2022 a bargain. However, the 2025 is a huge leap forward and represents the fastest production car Audi has ever made.</p>\n<p>Mine is the GT version, which has around 460 horsepower but boosts acceleration to 522 horses, while the RS version has 100 extra ponies. This gives my car a 3.6-second 0 to 60 and the RS version a 2.9-second 0 to 60. Impressive, right?</p>\n<p>Well, the 2025 GT jumps to 671 HP with a 3.4-second 0 to 60, the RS version jumps to 845 HP with a 2.8-second 0 to 60, and the RS GT Performance version has 912 HP and a 2.5-second 0 to 60. This closes in on the Tesla S Plaid’s 1.98 blistering 0 to 60. Still, when you consider that the fastest modified C8 Corvettes are running 2.2-second 0 to 60 times, these are impressive numbers for unmodified sedans.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>As noted, the e-tron GT is a GT sedan with about the same dimensions (though lower) as a Tesla Model S. It has a richer interior and, I think, far better looks.</p>\n<p>The new e-tron GT comes with an even more advanced suspension that not only raises the car near instantly to make it easier to get in and out of, but it also fights nose lift on acceleration and holds the car flatter on turns than I’ve ever seen in a production sedan or GT car. Its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm_zfWjmQhs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demo model</a> is impressive. The new one also has around 100 miles more range which makes an enormous difference, and it is, under the covers, a Porsche Taycan.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite features in the new car is the addition of an over-boost button that gives a massive kick when you push it. My 2022 model automatically does this when I floor it, but the button would be much more fun.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2022-model-audi-rs-e-tron.jpg\" alt=\"2022 model Audi RS e-tron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2022-model-audi-rs-e-tron.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2022-model-audi-rs-e-tron-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2022-model-audi-rs-e-tron-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>2022 Audi e-tron GT | Photo by Author</p>\n<p>The e-tron GT has never been a cheap date. It starts at over $100,000 and approaches $200,000 when configured in its highest performance mode. Then again, if you see someone in a supercar, you can embarrass the hell out of them. For me, that is often worth the price of admission, as the massive amount of torque the unique two-speed transmission and motor puts out is just incredible.</p>\n<p>I’m in love with my 2022 Audi e-tron GT, so the new 2025 model is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Artificial intelligence may be the next great thing for industry, but users still fear its shortcomings in business and digital testing.</p>\n<p>While customer experience (CX) and quality assessment are radically different, the associated risks may extend beyond satisfaction alone. Outcries persist that AI-powered CX systems produce subpar results and threaten human agent jobs.</p>\n<p>AI-powered digital testing tools raise similar concerns about accuracy and the potential replacement of human software testers. <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2027, 80% of enterprises will have integrated AI-augmented testing tools into their software engineering processes. In addition, the software testing market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% from 2023 to 2027.</p>\n<p>This growth has sparked fears that AI could replace software testers, with potential testing failures posing risks to the business software supply chain.</p>\n<p>Tal Barmeir, co-founder of AI-powered software testing firm <a href=\"https://blinq.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BlinqIO</a>, believes that will not happen. Instead, she sees AI reshaping the role of human testers into “AI-assisted testers,” where AI enhances their productivity and efficiency. Barmeir argues that the fear of AI replacing testers overlooks its collaborative potential to boost, rather than replace, their capabilities.</p>\n<p>“While AI integration in software testing is increasing, I think it is unlikely to replace human testers completely. AI-augmented tools excel at handling repetitive, data-intensive tasks, which can free up human testers to focus on more complex testing scenarios that require critical thinking and decision-making skills,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Addressing AI Fear Through Multichannel Strategies</h3>\n<p>Upskilling human workers to perform their jobs better in call centers, sales conversations, and testing centers can bear similar fruit. To that point, Barmeir offered that upskilling traditional testers to use AI-assisted tools can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency.</p>\n<p>“By integrating AI tools, testers can automate mundane aspects of the testing process, allowing them to handle more tests in less time and with greater accuracy. This shift not only speeds up the development cycle but also allows testers to focus on areas requiring deeper insight, such as user experience and security,” she explained.</p>\n<p>Barmeir presents a strong case for how using AI in software testing can improve business outcomes.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Humans will remain essential in software testing because they understand context, interpret nuanced user behaviors, and make ethical decisions. AI is adept at analyzing data and identifying patterns but cannot understand context or make value-driven decisions, areas where human judgment is crucial,” she reasoned.</p>\n<p>Additionally, advancements such as the AI Test Recorder elevate AI testing capabilities by automating the capture and reproduction of test scenarios. However, even with such tools enhancing the efficiency and scope of testing, human oversight remains necessary.</p>\n<p>“Humans play a critical role in monitoring and interpreting results, ensuring testing aligns with ethical standards and business objectives, and providing the contextual understanding that AI currently cannot achieve on its own,” she added.</p>\n<h3>Isolated Use Cases, Shared Human Roles</h3>\n<p>Does this same rationale apply to AI replacements of human workers in other use cases? According to Barmeir, AI’s impact on employment varies across sectors. In some areas, like manufacturing or data entry, AI might replace repetitive tasks traditionally performed by humans.</p>\n<p>“However, in fields requiring interpersonal skills, creative thinking, or complex decision-making, AI is more likely to augment human abilities rather than replace them. The key is to leverage AI as a tool that complements and enhances human skills,” she observed.</p>\n<p>Barmeir suggested that companies must adapt their sometimes misguided assumptions to change the growing anti-AI use in customer experience situations. They can do that by focusing on transparency, personalization, and control to mitigate growing concerns about AI in customer interactions.</p>\n<p>“This involves clearly communicating how AI is used, ensuring interactions are as personalized and empathetic as human ones, and giving users the option to choose between AI-assisted and human services,” she said.</p>\n<h3>The State of Software Testing</h3>\n<p>According to Barmeir, the software testing industry is undergoing a significant transformation driven by the integration of AI and machine learning technologies. Two things are at play.</p>\n<p>One is a strong focus on automating routine testing procedures to improve efficiency. The other is maintaining a robust framework for security and performance testing.</p>\n<p>“This shift toward automation is significantly shortening the time to market [TTM] for new software releases, which is a critical advantage in today’s fast-paced digital landscape,” she asserted.</p>\n<p>By enabling faster deployment cycles, businesses can respond more quickly to market demands and iterate on feedback more effectively. This approach enhances the development process and helps companies remain competitive in the digital economy.</p>\n<h3>Pros, Cons, and the Future for AI-Assisted Testers</h3>\n<p>Automation greatly accelerates the testing process and reduces human error. It allows testers to focus on more complex aspects of the software, enhancing testing efficiency and accuracy.</p>\n<p>AI improves upon manual testing by handling increased workloads or complexity more effectively. This capability makes it easier to expand testing efforts as software complexity and business needs grow.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The cons include the potential for overlooked issues and the need to continuously update to align with new software changes. Barmeir warned that this can require ongoing investment in time and resources.</p>\n<p>The future of AI-assisted testers looks promising, with opportunities to democratize the field and make it accessible at an entry-level. AI tools lower the barriers to entry by enabling those with less technical expertise to participate in testing processes.</p>\n<p>“This democratization means that more people can contribute to and engage in software testing, broadening the talent pool and fostering innovation,” she said.</p>\n<h3>Reshaping the QA Industry</h3>\n<p>Barmeir insisted that AI significantly enhances the QA industry by automating routine tasks and introducing sophisticated tools like <a href=\"https://automationsolutionz.github.io/docs/ai-recorder/ai-recorder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Test Recorder</a> and <a href=\"https://playwright.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playwright</a>. These tools work together to accelerate the testing process while ensuring high standards of quality and reliability in software products.</p>\n<p>The AI Test Recorder takes a test requirement and efficiently generates a complete test suite in Playwright. The platform’s code feature further simplifies the automation process by allowing users to create test scripts through recorded interactions with a website, eliminating the need for manual coding.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AMD is a global semiconductor company known for its high-performance computing and graphics solutions. In recent years, the company has made significant strides in its commitment to corporate responsibility, focusing on sustainability, diversity and inclusion, ethical governance, and community engagement.</p>\n<p>As AMD’s success has grown under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, it has shown the hallmarks of strengthening its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology while ensuring that its operations and products contribute positively to society and the environment.</p>\n<h3>4 Pillars of Corporate Responsibility</h3>\n<p>AMD’s corporate responsibility strategy is built on four pillars: environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, diversity, belonging, and inclusion (DBI), and community impact.</p>\n<p>Regarding environmental sustainability, AMD has dedicated itself to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting energy efficiency in its products and operations. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable energy across its global operations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, despite its fabless business model, AMD has focused on supply chain responsibility by ensuring that its suppliers adhere to ethical labor practices and environmental standards.</p>\n<p>Like many Silicon Valley companies, the attributes of diversity, belonging, and inclusion are core to AMD’s corporate ethos. The company strives to create a diverse workforce that reflects the global community it serves. AMD has committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel valued and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives.</p>\n<p>This focus on diversity and inclusion is about representation and building a culture of belonging and innovation.</p>\n<p>AMD’s community impact initiatives aim to leverage its technology and resources to address social challenges and promote educational opportunities. To that end, the company supports STEM education programs, community development projects, and disaster relief efforts, demonstrating its commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen.</p>\n<h3>Why Corporate Responsibility Matters to AMD</h3>\n<p>Corporate responsibility is crucial for AMD for several reasons. First, it aligns with the company’s core values and long-term vision of creating innovative products that benefit society. By prioritizing sustainability and ethical practices, AMD enhances its reputation as a responsible and forward-thinking company, which can attract customers, partners, and investors who share similar values.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>These initiatives help AMD mitigate risks associated with regulatory compliance and potential negative impacts on its brand image. Focusing on diversity and inclusion fosters a more innovative and dynamic workforce. Diverse teams bring different perspectives and ideas, which can drive creativity and lead to better decision-making and problem-solving. This consideration, in turn, can enhance AMD’s competitiveness in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry.</p>\n<h3>Differentiation From Other Semiconductor Firms</h3>\n<p>AMD differentiates itself from other semiconductor companies through its holistic approach to corporate responsibility. While many companies in the industry have sustainability and social responsibility programs, AMD’s emphasis on diversity and inclusion and its proactive stance on community impact set it apart.</p>\n<p>AMD’s commitment to reducing its environmental impact extends beyond its operations to include its products, where it strives to deliver energy-efficient solutions that help customers reduce their carbon footprints.</p>\n<p>Moreover, AMD’s transparent reporting and accountability measures demonstrate a genuine commitment to corporate responsibility. The company regularly publishes comprehensive corporate responsibility reports, providing stakeholders detailed information about its progress and challenges. This transparency builds trust and credibility with customers, investors, and the broader community.</p>\n<h3>Sustainability and Human Rights Initiatives</h3>\n<p>As spelled out in its recently released <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/corporate/cr/corporate-responsibility-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2023-2024 Corporate Responsibility Report</a>, AMD has prioritized key focus areas in its corporate responsibility strategy, investing in strategic projects and collaborations and reporting on its accomplishments and improvement areas openly and honestly.</p>\n<p>AMD has a long history of sustainability reporting and is building on this solid foundation as it works to strengthen stakeholder involvement, harness value chain collaborations, and anticipate upcoming legislation around sustainability reporting.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>AMD carried out a “double materiality” evaluation in 2023 to prioritize corporate responsibility concerns by examining them through two different lenses: the possible influence on the business and the potential impact the firm has on society and the environment.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, AMD carried out an initial Human Rights Saliency Assessment, which provided information for the revisions made to its worldwide human rights policy and strategy.</p>\n<p>These insights highlight the significance of leveraging collaborations in areas where AMD has influence, such as responsible mineral sourcing and supplier sustainability performance, while simultaneously driving progress in areas where AMD has control, such as reducing operational emissions, advancing energy efficiency, and contributing to local communities in which it operates.</p>\n<h3>Global Collaborations</h3>\n<p>To address systemic industry concerns, such as reducing risks associated with forced labor in the supply chain and decarbonizing Scope 3 emissions, AMD occupies vital positions in the <a href=\"https://www.responsiblebusiness.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Responsible Business Alliance</a> (RBA), the world’s largest industry coalition committed to supply chain sustainability.</p>\n<p>The RBA Board of Directors and the Senior Environmental Advisory Team continue to recognize AMD as a permanent member of their respective boards. In addition, the company attended the first-ever RBA Forced Labor Summit in Washington, D.C., which attracted leaders worldwide. AMD has also provided financial support to the RBA audit fund for the Responsible Minerals Initiative and guided the RBA environmental strategy roadmap.</p>\n<p>In 2023, the company supported and was a founding member of the Energy Collaborative of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium. Its goal was to assist in improving access to renewable energy sources throughout the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to this work, AMD started working on a climate transition action plan (CTAP) that contains climate scenario studies.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>These analyses are vital for examining different futures with related strategic consequences, such as physical dangers and market opportunities. The CTAP is still somewhat of a work in progress, and the company will need to continue to report on its decarbonization plan, schedule, and progress.</p>\n<p>Between 2020 and 2023, AMD more than doubled the amount of renewable energy sourced for its operations, going from 36 to 83 gigawatt-hours, which is not an inconsiderable feat.</p>\n<p>Additionally, AMD continued to expand its sustainability engagements with its “manufacturing suppliers,” companies that AMD purchases directly from and offers direct materials and manufacturing services. By 2023, 84% of these suppliers had set public greenhouse gas objectives, and 83% of the facilities they managed had been subjected to RBA audits (since 2020).</p>\n<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Despite AMD’s impressive efforts in corporate responsibility — focusing on sustainability, diversity, and community impact — these initiatives have often been overshadowed by the company’s recent business success in the competitive semiconductor market.</p>\n<p>AMD’s innovative products and significant market share gains against competitors like Intel and Nvidia have captured much public and media attention.</p>\n<p>As its success continues, AMD will be subject to further scrutiny regarding its corporate responsibility initiatives, a challenge it is already familiar with.</p>\n<p>While its recent business achievements are noteworthy, it is unfortunate that AMD’s robust corporate responsibility strategy has not received the same recognition. The company has been at the forefront of integrating ethical practices and sustainability into its operations and products, demonstrating a commitment to being a responsible corporate entity.</p>\n<p>AMD’s dedication to these principles enhances its reputation and contributes positively to society and the environment. Those are admirable goals, and the industry should recognize and acknowledge AMD’s dual focus on business excellence and corporate responsibility. This holistic approach is vital for sustainable long-term growth and positive global impact.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>For the past two decades, I’ve lived in condo-style apartments in various cities, including Houston, Austin, Coral Gables, San Jose, and Las Vegas. I yearned for the day when I could have a gas grill on the patio wherever I lived, but I’ve been subject to homeowner association rules that prohibit gas grills on patios.</p>\n<p>The gas grill was a staple of my upbringing as a child and young adult in New Jersey, and the smell of grilled hamburgers and steaks with those characteristic charbroil marks that a gas grill makes still haunts my dreams. This memory faded after moving in the early 1990s and becoming an apartment or condo dweller.</p>\n<p>A new startup, Current Backyard, caught my attention. It promised to bring back those days with an electric grill that could emulate the heat of a gas grill — which traditional electric grills typically cannot deliver — and even char food like a gas grill. I was skeptical, to say the least, but decided to test it out.</p>\n<h3>Out-of-the-Box Experience</h3>\n<p>On a typically hot 105-degree day in Las Vegas, I received the new Model G Dual Zone Electric Grill from Current Backyard, so I set it up in my townhome living room, just five feet from my outdoor patio.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Grill-delivery-box.jpg\" alt=\"Current Backyard Grill delivery box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Grill-delivery-box.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Grill-delivery-box-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Grill-delivery-box-768x395.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>There was no need to be concerned about propane gas or charcoal smoke. I manually turned on the grill (an important safety feature) and set each side to a preset temperature before searching the app for recipes. I grilled a couple of filet mignon, asparagus, and a few ears of corn and then turned the grill to Clean, which blasted the grilling parts with high heat for half an hour.</p>\n<p>The grill notified my iPhone when each side of the grilling surface reached the proper temperature and when my timings were complete. I’ve since used the meat thermometer probes that connect to the side of the front panel, and I received notifications for these as well.</p>\n<p>The grill’s display is pleasingly bright and large, making it simple to see the current mode and temperature. You don’t need an app to use this gadget, which is a huge plus. Everything can be managed from the front screen. However, the connected app allows you to monitor the grill’s temperature and its integrated timer if you need to walk back into your home.</p>\n<h3>Stunning Design</h3>\n<p>This grill looks stunning. The bronze accent on the right side of the handle reflects the metal logo in the center of the grill cover.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-patio.jpg\" alt=\"Current Backyard Smart Grill on patio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-patio.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-patio-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-patio-768x499.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Everything is in rounded rectangles, and the various gray shades contribute to a sense of quality and polish. It’s a barbecue you won’t mind having others look at, even when you’re not cooking. If you didn’t know it, this grill looks like a traditional gas grill from a sheer appearance standpoint.</p>\n<p>The side tables are easy to install and remove but remain in place once installed. Everything feels sturdy, from the exterior to the interior, with heavy-duty yet readily removable grills over the electric heating components. Optional cabinet doors are available to hide the warming trays.</p>\n<h3>Smartphone App Features</h3>\n<p>Cooking on the grill is simple: set the temperature, add the meal, and turn as needed. For high-heat scenarios, the grill can reach 700 degrees, which is remarkable for an electric grill. While I’m away from the grill, receiving messages on my phone makes outdoor cooking even more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The Current Backyard app, which supports both Apple iOS and Google Android, includes recipes with buttons to pre-heat the grill and set cooking timers, which are helpful but lack specific information.</p>\n<p>For example, when I wanted to cook some steaks to medium-rare, the app simply told me to use the thermometer probes to determine the desired level of doneness. I still had to look up the internal temperature that the meat needed to reach on another cooking website. Let’s hope that Current Backyard adjusts the app in the future, as incorporating that information into an app would make it fantastic.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>I did experience some screen formatting issues with the Current Backyard app, which distorted some of the information displayed. Still, I attribute that to the fact I’ve been using beta versions of the upcoming iOS 18 app. I’m sure the problem will be solved when Apple formally releases iOS 18 to the public in September.</p>\n<p>Another cool feature that could improve the user experience is the ability to display two recipes simultaneously. Indeed, that may be “advanced dance lessons” for some users, but a benefit of a dual-sided grill is the ability to cook multiple things at once. Currently, the software forces you to switch between recipes and search for a second meal while cooking.</p>\n<h3>Manual Operation a Breeze</h3>\n<p>Manually utilizing the Model G Dual-Zone Electric Grill is very simple. This product is ideal if you want a fantastic electric grill that looks excellent and can cook up to 700 degrees.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the temperature on each side, use the provided thermometer probes, and set timers all from the front panel controls, which include a large, clickable knob and numerous smaller touchable buttons.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-LED-display.jpg\" alt=\"The Current Backyard smart grill LED panel is bright and easy to read, even in direct sunshine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-LED-display.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-LED-display-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Current-Backyard-Smart-Grill-LED-display-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The LED panel on the Current Backyard grill is bright and easy to read, even in direct sunlight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It took about 15 minutes for the Current Backyard to hit 650 degrees from a cold start, unlike a gas grill, which could hit that temperature in less than 10 minutes. Still, that wasn’t a showstopper for me.</p>\n<h3>Assembly and Cleaning</h3>\n<p>On the positive side, it only took about two hours to assemble the Current Model G Dual-Zone Electric Grill, which, according to the well-designed installation videos you can watch on your smartphone or tablet, required two people to lift the cooking unit and install it on the cart. I was able to assemble it entirely by myself.</p>\n<p>Cleaning the barbecue is a mixed bag. It has four removable grills that may be simply removed and reattached. They quickly discolor after cooking on them once, although the cleaning mode reduces any remaining food particles to ash. Still, you’ll need some steel wool to scrape some of that off in the sink to avoid adding carbonized particles to your meals. I’ve been using a wet sponge designed to clean gas grills and remove any residue.</p>\n<h3>Market Size and Potential</h3>\n<p>The apartment and condo market in the United States is a significant segment of the housing industry, with over 20 million apartment units and millions of condominiums nationwide.</p>\n<p>The multifamily housing market, including apartments and condos, is valued at over $3 trillion. This sector has experienced steady growth driven by increasing urbanization, demographic shifts, and a growing preference for flexible living arrangements in urban areas.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>As cities expand and population densities rise, the demand for apartments and condos continues to be a key driver in the real estate market. That’s a huge potential market for the Current Backyard smart grill since most cannot have gas-based grills on patios due to HOA or landlord restrictions.</p>\n<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>\n<p>The standard Current Backyard Model G Zone Grill starts at $899, with everything you need to get off to the races. The company also sells accessories like a soft cover to protect the grill and stand from the elements.</p>\n<p>At $899, this barbecue is an affordable, excellent choice for anyone searching for a durable, functional, and stylish grill that is ideal for outdoor cooking and, with proper ventilation, can also be used indoors. It delivers deliciously tasting food.</p>\n<p>The smart features allow you to step away from the grill more often and rely on notifications to assist in managing the heat and cooking time, though the app could use a few improvements to be truly effective. Those looking for a stylish, effective electric grill with innovative features should consider this one.</p>\n<p>The Current Backyard smart grill and accessories are available on the <a href=\"https://www.currentbackyard.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">company’s website</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The pre-built Linux Kubuntu Focus Iridium laptop line is an unexpectedly good alternative to running any Linux operating system on converted Windows PCs.</p>\n<p>Born almost five years ago, Focus Computers targeted developers, power users, and productivity enthusiasts as an alternative to Mac and Windows computers. Both the Ir16 and the Ir14 combine Carbon Systems’ enterprise-class hardware with excellent OS integration and Linux-first support from Kubuntu Focus.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits Linux provides is the option to choose from literally dozens of distributions to install on almost any new or old desktop or laptop PC. That is a good strategy for Linux newcomers looking for a free operating system to install on their existing computers.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to a powerful built-for-Linux system from Kubuntu Focus eliminates potential hardware-inflicted glitches. It spares you from the time-consuming process of finding, downloading, and installing different types of Linux OSes.</p>\n<p>Kubuntu Focus offers a customized version of Kubuntu, one of the most popular Linux distributions based on Ubuntu. It is tweaked to maximize performance and includes a well-integrated collection of system tools unavailable elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer, <a href=\"https://kfocus.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kubuntu Focus</a>, released two new laptops as second-generation replacements. The Iridium lineup includes five models with screen sizes ranging from 14 to 15.6 inches and 17.3 inches.</p>\n<p>The second-generation 16-inch laptop (along with the 14-inch model) arrived in June with some nice upgrades in RAM and storage and a newer processor (Intel i5-13500h 12-core/16-thread). Pricing for the new Ir16 starts at $1,145, and the new Ir14 starts at $1,080.</p>\n<p>The internals are impressive. Both laptops are powered by an Intel i5-13500H CPU with integrated Iris Xe graphics at 1.65 GHz. The no-flex, backlit keyboard provides impeccable tactile feedback.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/kfocus-ir16-gen2-keyboard.jpg\" alt=\"Kubuntu Focus Ir16 Gen 2 laptop keyboard features\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\"></p>\n<p>The centered, large glass precision touchpad supports multi-touch, scrolling, and fast toggle. Both models feature dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer sent me an Ir16 loaner to review. That laptop far exceeded what I expected.</p>\n<h3>Worthwhile Change of Approach for Linux Users</h3>\n<p>Buying a built-for-Linux computer is not new or innovative. Several enterprise computer makers, such as HP and Lenovo, offer computers with Linux pre-installed rather than Microsoft Windows. Numerous other manufacturers offer their hardware lines with a choice of off-the-shelf Linux distributions or an in-house derivative.</p>\n<p>I have sampled several pre-built with Linux options and found most of them less than ideal. I either disliked the selected pre-installed Linux distro family or found the included desktop environment uninviting.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the manufacturer did not fine-tune the operating system to maximize software performance with the hardware. So, the only fix available was to install a different Linux distro myself. For me, that approach negated the value of buying a pre-installed Linux computer.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The KFocus approach changed my perception of buying a dedicated Linux computer. The Kubuntu distro, launched in October 2004, is a highly regarded Linux distribution. It is an official flavor of the Ubuntu operating system that uses the KDE Plasma Desktop instead of Ubuntu’s default Gnome desktop environment.</p>\n<p>The Kubuntu Focus Iridium line ships with the new Kubuntu Focus Suite, <a href=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/story/upgrading-to-ubuntu-24-04-lts-noble-numbat-step-by-step-guide-177359.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">24.04 LTS Noble Numbat</a>. You can order either laptop configured with up to 96 GB of dual-channel DDR5 RAM and dual-NVMe 8.0 TB of storage. Full-disk encryption is standard (but optional), and a YubiKey is available.</p>\n<p>I am very familiar with the KDE Plasma desktop. Over the years, I have learned to tolerate it. The Focus installation left nearly nothing to tolerate.</p>\n<p>Its specialized software and tweaked interface made me an instant fan. For instance, an 11-page Hints Widget displayed at the top-right corner of the desktop provides handy hints for beginners and seasoned Linux veterans.</p>\n<h3>Software Solutions Surprisingly Solid Selling Point</h3>\n<p>The standard KDE Plasma desktop in other Kubuntu releases is a powerful computing environment. But it is not the most user-friendly or intuitive.</p>\n<p>Two of my strongest dislikes are the awkward steps needed to engage the virtual desktops and the sometimes confusing operation of the desktop widgets. I also was dissatisfied with the caliber of bundled applications developed by the KDE developers.</p>\n<p>Focus solved those inadequacies and more with model-specific shortcuts for tiling windows, switching desktops, and accessing hardware controls like brightness, volume, sleep mode, and screenshots. I also found the purpose-built collection of recommended apps very helpful.</p>\n<p>The community version of KDE Plasma found in most Kubuntu iterations has KDE-specific apps that work reasonably well on most installations. Glitches do occur depending on the hardware configuration at hand.</p>\n<p>Curated Apps displayed in a browser window make it simple to find a recommended program for a specific purpose.</p>\n<h3>Durable Design Doubles Desirability</h3>\n<p>My review unit checked almost all the boxes for quality, performance, and productivity. The Ir16 comes with a durable magnesium metal chassis and lid.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/kfocus-ir16-gen2-open-display.jpg\" alt=\"Kubuntu Focus Ir16 Gen 2 laptop open view\" width=\"800\" height=\"670\"></p>\n<p>It had 32 GB DDR5 RAM and a 1,000 GB Samsung 3500 MBps storage drive. Measuring 14.1″ x 9.7″ x 0.7,” its 3.30 lbs. was a delight to carry around. The screen display is a 450 nit/16:10 wide-angle LED (IPS/WUXGA) panel.</p>\n<p>The system is stock Kubuntu 22.04 LTS with Focus hardware integration, optimizations, and tools delivered on top. The developer also rejected plans to issue interim releases with upgrades every nine months.</p>\n<p>The developer’s strategy paid off. The company decided not to build a separate Linux distribution and ecosystem with yet another desktop environment. Instead, it “focused” on working and supporting Kubuntu, Ubuntu, and KDE directly.</p>\n<p>Keep that LTS concept in mind. If you decide to install an interim release over the LTS version or run another laptop environment, the company will not support or fix what does not work.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>The Kubuntu Focus Ir16 laptop offers significant improvements over many other pre-built Linux laptops. A few modifications would make it better.</p>\n<p>For instance, the hardware has a good but not great selection of ports: one USB-C, one USB-A, a single HDMI, and an SD card reader.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/kfocus-ir16-gen2-ports.jpg\" alt=\"Kubuntu Focus Ir16 Gen 2 laptop ports\" width=\"1000\" height=\"336\"></p>\n<p>A better assortment of ports would handle additional peripherals. Also, it has no Ethernet port, so I had to plug in a USB Ethernet adapter, which took up one of the two USB ports.</p>\n<p>The Focus line is designed for functionality, not attractiveness. Its outer appearance is dull, flat black with no other branding to identify the make or model. You can purchase an optional silver circular metal emblem.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you get a stick-on laminate emblem. The starkness of the case does nothing to project a classy brand recognition.</p>\n<div>\n<h4>Kubuntu Focus Ir16 GEN 2 Manufacturer’s Technical Specifications</h4>\n<h5>Display</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>16.0” (406mm) LED IPS @ 90 Hz</li>\n<li>WQXGA 2560 x 1600 16:10</li>\n<li>Narrow Bezel Matte</li>\n<li>Viewing Angles &gt; 150/150/150°</li>\n<li>Open Angle of 145°</li>\n<li>Vibrant &gt; 100% sRGB Color</li>\n<li>Max Brightness &gt; 450cd/m²</li>\n<li>Max Contrast &gt; 1200:1</li>\n<li>Connect up to 2 external displays at 4k with USB-C and HDMI</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Processor</h5>\n<p>Intel Core i5-13500H</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance-Biased H-Series</li>\n<li>2.6 GHz Base, 4.7 GHz Turbo</li>\n<li>12 Cores, 16 Threads</li>\n<li>18 MB Smart Cache</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Graphics</h5>\n<p>Intel Iris® Xe Graphics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>80 Execution Units up to 1.45 GHz</li>\n<li>Shared System VRAM</li>\n<li>Requires Dual-Channel RAM (16 GB+) for Maximum Performance</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Memory</h5>\n<p>Dual Channel DDR5-4800 or DDR5-5200</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 x 262 Pin SODIMM</li>\n<li>Up to 96 GB</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Storage</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>2 x M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 4 x 4</li>\n<li>Samsung Read/Write Speeds up to 3500/3200 MB/s</li>\n<li>Samsung Read/Write Speeds up to 7450/6900 MB/s</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Chassis</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>All Magnesium Alloy External Surfaces</li>\n<li>Resin Screen Bezel and Keys</li>\n<li>3.3 lb (1.5 kg) with Battery</li>\n<li>14.0 x 9.7 x 0.7 in (356 x 246 x 18 mm)</li>\n<li>User Accessible Components Include Disk, RAM, Wi-Fi, Battery, Fans</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Battery</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>80 WHr Embedded 4 Cell Smart Lithium-Ion Battery</li>\n<li>Up To 8 Hours Modest Use with Medium-Low Display Brightness, 6 Hours Typical</li>\n<li>Continuous Video Playback Loop: 7.5 hours</li>\n<li>90 Minute Fast-Charge</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Power Supply</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>120W AC Adapter:\n<ul>\n<li>Input 100-240 V ~ 1.9A 50-60 Hz</li>\n<li>Output 20V, DC, 6.0A</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Optional 100 W USB-C Charging</li>\n<li>WARNING: Lower-power USB chargers will degrade performance.</li>\n<li>Many USB-C Monitors can charge and display simultaneously, but be wary if charging output is below 100W.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Keyboard</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Single Zone White LED Backlight</li>\n<li>User Configurable 4 Levels with Function Key</li>\n<li>Kubuntu Super Key</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Touchpad</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Precision Glass Centered 6.1 x 4.0 in (155 x 102 mm) Touchpad</li>\n<li>Configured with Multi-Touch and Finger Scroll</li>\n<li>Quick Toggle Meta + Space</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Network and Bluetooth</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX 211, M.2 2230 Card</li>\n<li>Dual-Band 2.4 and 5 GHz</li>\n<li>WLAN 802.11 AC/A/B/G/N/AC/AX</li>\n<li>2×2 Communication Channels</li>\n<li>300 Mbit/s @2.4 GHz; 2.4 Gbit/s @ 5 GHz</li>\n<li>Dual-Mode Bluetooth 5.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Webcam</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>2.1 MegaPixel HD 1080p (1920 x 1080)</li>\n<li>Top-Center Mounted</li>\n<li>Integrated Microphone Array</li>\n<li>Physical Security Shutter</li>\n<li>In-Use Blue LED Indicator</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Sound</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated Microphone Array with Noise Suppression</li>\n<li>2 x 2 W Speakers</li>\n<li>High Definition Analog Over 3.5mm 2-in-1 Audio Jack</li>\n<li>Digital Audio Over HDMI</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Ports</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>1 x USB-C 3.2 / Thunderbolt 4 / 100 W DC-IN, DisplayPort, Up to 40 Gbit/s</li>\n<li>1 x USB-C 3.2, Up to 10 Gbit/s</li>\n<li>1 x HDMI 2.1</li>\n<li>2 x USB-A 3.1</li>\n<li>1 x SD Card Reader</li>\n<li>1 x 2-in-1 Audio Jack – Headphone and Microphone</li>\n<li>1 x Kensington Lock</li>\n<li>1 x DC-IN Power Connection</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Slots and Expansion</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>3 x M.2 Card Slots</li>\n<li>1 x WLAN Combo M.2 2230 Card with PCIe and USB Interface</li>\n<li>2 x NVMe M.2 2280 Card with PCIe Gen 4×4 Interface</li>\n<li>Other Expansion Opportunities</li>\n<li>Thunderbolt 4 Supports eGPUs and multiple external displays</li>\n<li>Connect up to 2 additional 4k displays (HDMI, 1 x USB-C)</li>\n<li>User Expandable NVMe, and RAM</li>\n<li>Opens with Standard Phillips Screwdriver</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Cooling</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Dual Fans With Heat Pipes</li>\n<li>BIOS Controlled Fan Profiles</li>\n<li>Quiet by Default</li>\n<li>“Silent” Profile Available</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Security</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Kensington Lock Mount</li>\n<li>Webcam Physical Security Shutter</li>\n<li>Webcam In-Use Blue LED Indicator</li>\n<li>Optional No-Cost Full Disk Encryption</li>\n<li>Optional Pre-Configured YubiKey 5 NFC 2FA</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Warranty</h5>\n<p>One- to Three-Year Limited Warranty with Linux-First Support</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>Credits: The images featured in this article are courtesy of Kubuntu Focus or photographed by the author.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><i></i> Suggest a Review</h3>\n<p>Is there a Linux software application or distro you’d like to suggest for review?

      },
      "content": "<p>A common challenge with using artificial intelligence in the workplace is that many employees lack proper training to use AI effectively.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft’s and LinkedIn’s 2024 Work Trend Index on the State of AI at Work, released in May, only 39% of AI users receive workplace training. The report identifies four categories of workers: skeptics, reluctant users, poorly or untrained users, and power users.</p>\n<p>Power users, who comprise 78% of this last category, may pose the greatest challenge for IT departments. They often bring their own AI tools to work to improve job performance. In smaller companies, 80% of these power users use AI connections discreetly, without IT’s awareness.</p>\n<p>As AI reshapes work environments, its most significant potential lies in enhancing the human skills that define employee performance — creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving, noted Juan Betancourt, CEO at <a href=\"https://www.humantelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Humantelligence</a>. His company develops individualized training strategies to better train leaders and their workers to integrate AI safely and efficiently.</p>\n<p>With so few workers getting real on-the-job training to employ AI, he urges companies to close this crucial training gap. Humantelligence software integrates into organizations’ workflows. The training and the plug-in platform combine to cultivate a learning environment that accelerates career growth and business innovation, he explained.</p>\n<p>Betancourt says the training concept has been well received when pitched to business leaders but has seen slow adoption rates so far. He describes Humantelligence’s approach as AI-based and unique compared to other solutions.</p>\n<p>“Only one in five companies to whom we present it ends up buying the product, which is shocking. Once they buy it, they love it,” Betancourt told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>How AI Is Reshaping the Workplace</h3>\n<p>The Microsoft-LinkedIn AI usage report revealed that many employees quietly use AI tools without proper guidance or clearance from leadership.</p>\n<p>The research is based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, labor and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals, and research with Fortune 500 customers. The results show how, in one year, AI is influencing how people work, lead, and hire worldwide.</p>\n<p>For example, 52% of employees who use AI at work are reluctant to admit they rely on it for critical tasks. Additionally, 53% worry that using AI for important tasks might make them seem replaceable.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The report suggests that companies miss out on its full benefits by not embracing AI strategically. This lack of oversight also increases the risk of compromised company data, as leadership focuses on cybersecurity and privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>“AI is redefining work, and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in an announcement about the survey’s results.</p>\n<p>He added that leaders who prioritize agility over stability and invest in internal skill-building will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged, and equitable teams.</p>\n<h3>Tailoring AI Training to Diverse Learning Styles</h3>\n<p>Learning styles differ. Some people might learn conceptually, not with examples and data-driven results. Others might like to learn independently, figuring things out on their own. Betancourt explained that some people like tinkering with the answers, and others like classroom environments with groups so they can ask questions.</p>\n<p>With so many different learning styles, Humantelligence’s tool identifies every individual’s learning style. The company’s AI-based training platform and maintenance methods are unique because they allow training through individually prescribed approaches.</p>\n<p>“We do that at an individual level,” he offered. “It’s much more involved than just how to handle the chat box dealing with incoming calls and the live agents. It’s much more compliant.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>That provides diversification for training groups of people. For instance, he noted, the way you train all the call center agents who have a particular type of profile in terms of their psychometrics, behaviors, and motivators is very different from how the work styles, training framework, and content are delivered to the accounting, finance, and sales departments.</p>\n<p>“Our tool works for AI training in all industries. It is less verticalized by industry and more verticalized by every person. Our tool, although delivered by the company, allows people to train all employees,” he said, adding that workers’ existing skill levels do not matter.</p>\n<h3>Continuous AI Training</h3>\n<p>Humantelligence’s new training product is all about teaching workers to use AI in their jobs. The product focuses solely on teaching workers how to use AI in their jobs, not on other training objectives. However, the AI-driven feature that identifies workers’ inherent learning styles also supports various training objectives.</p>\n<p>Instead of offering a one-time, workshop-based solution, the software development firm provides a tool for ongoing optimization. It ensures that 90% of the company’s workforce receives continuous training across any platform or delivery method every day, every week.</p>\n<p>“We operationalize insights with Al. So that is a huge difference that AI allows the training to happen at the right time for the right person when they need it at that moment,” added Betancourt.</p>\n<p>Since starting Humantelligence in 2016, its focus has evolved as businesses’ needs have changed. The pathway followed developing workplace solutions that morphed through pre-to-post Covid circumstances, leading to the AI explosion that started nearly two years ago.</p>\n<p>“We have four phases of the company, so we’ve pivoted three times from the original idea of what we were doing. AI has only been the most recent version of what we do,” Betancourt shared.</p>\n<h3>Adapting AI to Evolving Business Needs</h3>\n<p>The start-up’s initial mission was to use psychometric insights on employees to learn why people perform based on their psychology. The psychometric tool provided data on the behaviors of high performers versus low performers and provided an inkling of the different motivations driving their work styles.</p>\n<p>During the company’s first four years, that insight ranking product became a recruiting tool based on algorithmic matching. Sort of a light AI back then, the results allowed companies to select from the top five matches out of thousands of applicants for a position in any company.</p>\n<p>Then Covid hit, and Humantelligence lost all revenue. Nobody was using software to hire. Nobody was hiring, lamented Betancourt.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The shift in business needs led to the first pivot — developing a platform for culture management. The platform used psychometric analysis to assess existing employees, which helped leaders and co-workers see an aggregate of their team’s culture or dynamics. This insight resulted in tips on managing or collaborating better within a team.</p>\n<p>“After two years, we integrated, kind of like Grammarly is integrating its workflows. We integrated this culture management, all those email insights into Teams, into Slack, so that while you are in any platform from communicating or collaborating, you could pull up a profile,” Betancourt said of the transition to the next pivotal platform.</p>\n<p>The final pivot resulted from AI’s advancements over the last 18 months. AI provides a tool for delivering exact insights for each person in any environment. Hence, Humantelligence built a better process for companies to train their workers to use AI.</p>\n<h3>Barriers to AI Adoption in the Workplace</h3>\n<p>According to Betancourt, there are specific reasons why prospective customers do not move forward after expressing positive reactions in presentations about the software.</p>\n<p>“It is expensive. It is more budget. They do not know the ROI,” he reasoned. “You can’t put a number for return on investment on people will learn quicker or learn better.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, despite loving all the insights on training, some companies do not want them delivered through AI. They ask for a version with all the insights but delivered manually, he added.</p>\n<p>“They want it to be more hand-fed,” he quipped.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is the lack of leadership structure to handle AI. Financing the training often falls between the CIO and CTO, creating budgeting issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re plugging into communication and collaboration platforms. That is all under the CTO, but training sits under HR. So, one of the problems is there is no head of AI training. There is no Chief AI Officer,” he noted.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I’m writing this before the September 10 presidential debate to avoid any influence on my perspective. Both candidates are reportedly preparing by using surrogates to stand in for their opponents. This strategy doesn’t always work well and has proven ineffective in previous debates.</p>\n<p>The problem with using human surrogates is that unless the person prepares for the role like a professional actor by immersing themselves in the character, their performance, and thus their effectiveness, will be highly unreliable.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is that the stand-in won’t feel as comfortable with the personal attacks on someone they work for, further reducing their effectiveness as a training dummy. However, a simulation tool like Nvidia Omniverse, backed by a conversational AI trained on the opponent’s past behavior and public social media posts, could create a far more accurate emulation of that opponent.</p>\n<p>In addition, this capability wouldn’t just be applied to presidential candidates but to people running for lower offices, congressional debates, legal debates in court trials, and discussions between business managers trying to get a part of a budget that can only support one.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss the future of debate preparation. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, smart glasses from Phantom Technology that are due out early next year and are designed to reduce distractions from your smartphone or PC.</p>\n<h3>Why Winning Debates Is Important</h3>\n<p>Whether talking about politics, legal fights, or business, the ability to win a debate is important.</p>\n<p>One reason that OJ Simpson won his trial was that the opposing counsel brought out a pair of gloves that didn’t fit, and Simpson’s legal team created the brilliant phrase “if it doesn’t fit, you must acquit,” winning them the trial. A mock trial done properly and with an accurate stand-in for OJ could have predicted this and informed the prosecutors that the path they were taking would be catastrophic to their case.</p>\n<p>When I was pre-law, I attended moot court. While it was fun, it was different enough from an actual court (which I later attended a lot, both as a juror and a litigant) to make it less useful than it otherwise would have been.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Before Apple created the iPhone, working groups in Palm and Microsoft argued that an iPhone-like phone that focuses on fun stuff for consumers was a future direction for their companies. That debate was lost at Microsoft and resulted in Zune being one of Microsoft’s least successful offerings. That set the foundation for the eventual replacement of Microsoft’s then-CEO, Steve Ballmer (he was on team Zune).</p>\n<p>Finally, we all get into debates with our families, neighbors, friends, co-workers, employers, and even our kids. Often, we degrade into anger and threats, resulting in less-than-ideal outcomes, so learning to debate could help us better control our futures. By the way, debate competitions do help, but few participate</p>\n<h3>Simulated Debates</h3>\n<p>While I’m focused on Nvidia Omniverse because it is the tool I know, there are other simulation tools. As AI advances, an increasing number of generative AI tools will be able to learn from the public activities of the people you want to convince. You could create more accurate models of juries to increase the win ratios or identify the potential for loss, allowing for a settlement offer that would end with a better result than a trial you can’t win.</p>\n<p>When it comes to elections, I still remember the one line that I believe won Ronald Reagan the presidency during his debate with Walter Mondale since Reagan faced questions about his age. It’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJhCjMfRndk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still funny</a> today — even Mondale couldn’t help but laugh. That remark resonated far beyond the debate, sparking conversations at our dinner table for weeks; decades later, it’s still a topic we revisit.</p>\n<p>However, with political candidates, particularly at the top level, there’s a wealth of information about how they perform at events, debates, conferences, and other public appearances. AI could distill this data into a few variations of how they might answer each likely question. You could even create AI simulations of the debate moderators, allowing for comprehensive dress rehearsals and increasing the chances of a successful debate performance.</p>\n<p>I think the first politician or attorney who learns how to use this tool well will be able to dominate their respective fields. But what if both sides use this method?</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Using a simulation tool like Omniverse will be a game-changer if one side or the other exclusively uses it, but if both sides use it, things get interesting. In effect, you get highly prepared candidates focused on the issues that matter most to the public rather than drifting into irrelevant topics. As a result, the debates become more entertaining, informative, and engaging.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This preparation would also inform debaters if they had a non-winnable argument.

The question is when, not if, it is coming.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Journey Lens Smart Glasses</h3>\n<p>One of the life-changing things that is coming is AI human enhancement products. These are products backed by AI that can make our lives better. At last week’s <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/apple-weaves-ai-into-latest-watch-airpods-iphone-models-179356.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple event</a>, we saw several products focused on addressing sleep apnea and hearing loss and providing you with a far better Siri experience (it’s about time).</p>\n<p>Still, one area no one has addressed is how to improve focus. While there are people with extreme problems in this regard, I think we all have issues with focus, given we are surrounded by tech.</p>\n<p>Recently, I was forced to sit at a spa without my phone, and I was able to think through a lot of things that needed thinking through. Our distractions consist of everything from family problems, particularly with children who need to engage face-to-face to learn how to properly engage face-to-face, to traffic accidents because someone can’t resist looking at the phone rather than where they are going.</p>\n<p>The coming smart glasses and related application from Phantom Technology — called <a href=\"https://www.phantomtech.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Journey Lens</a> — is designed to provide a heads-up display, microphone, 2K camera, and speakers. These features enable you to designate critical information so you don’t feel the need to pick up your phone and be distracted by the non-critical stuff going on, like social media, which can be a huge time sink.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Journey-Lens-smart-glasses.jpg\" alt=\"Journey Lens smart glasses by Phantom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Journey-Lens-smart-glasses.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Journey-Lens-smart-glasses-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Journey-Lens-smart-glasses-768x346.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Journey Lens smart glasses for focus and wellbeing (Image courtesy of Phantom Technology)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>These are some of the least expensive smart glasses in the market at a reasonable $200 (projected price) plus costs for custom lenses. They have far more functionality than the more limited Meta glasses, which lack a display.</p>\n<p>The application they will come with is gamified to help train you to be more focused and to avoid distractions you agree are unnecessary. The camera captures what you are seeing, but the app translates the image into a description sent to the cloud if you want to ask a question about what you saw while the image is retained on your phone.</p>\n<p>Think of being able to ask about something you are looking at or provide more detailed information about an accident or crime you have observed while preserving the privacy of whom you are looking at. I expect there may still be a problem with using these glasses in secure sites or public restrooms regardless of this protection, suggesting geo-fencing will need to be a near-term enhancement.</p>\n<p>Personal technology makes it harder for us to focus, be productive, and get things done. But because we often need to be able to report what we see, like with <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-deadly-side-of-social-media-79307.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this event</a> I remember very well, these glasses could make my life more productive, keep me safer, and help me keep others safer by more accurately reporting hazards or crimes. As a result, Journey Lens smart glasses are my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Hacker breaches targeting corporate and personal data are worsening despite businesses and individual users adopting safe computing strategies, highlighting gaps in cybersecurity expertise. Cybersecurity workforce developer <a href=\"https://www.nukudo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NukuDo</a> addresses these gaps by offering specialized training that leads to guaranteed jobs in computer security.</p>\n<p>The United States is facing a surge in major data breaches, including the theft of all U.S. Social Security numbers, a Chinese government attack on internet providers, and Iranian assaults on presidential campaigns. These incidents highlight the nation’s cybersecurity challenges, including a 400,000-specialist shortfall reported by the White House, despite extensive recruitment efforts.</p>\n<p>For example, a hacker known as USDoD allegedly stole personal data from National Public Data, an online background check service provider, including the full names and former and complete addresses of 2.9 billion people going back 30 years. In recent months, hackers backed by the Chinese government penetrated U.S. internet service providers to spy on users.</p>\n<p>Two ever-present obstacles enterprises face in locking down their cyber protections are a lack of cyber skills in existing IT workers and a shortage of qualified job candidates to bolster cybersecurity teams. Michael Blair, managing director of NukuDo, initiated a training program to address both issues.</p>\n<p>Blair offers qualified candidates a six-month paid training program at $4,000 per month, a 401(k), and coverage for 100% of an individual’s health care costs. The program is followed by direct employment for three years. The package provides a hands-on learning experience and guaranteed employment opportunities open to a wide range of applicants, including recent high school graduates.</p>\n<p>“We are attempting to revolutionize cybersecurity training. Our program is about doing something distinctly different,” Blair told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Proven Training Model Expands Beyond Academia</h3>\n<p>The training facility, based in San Antonio, is designed to prepare the cybersecurity trainees for success at a level that the future employer would not get if hiring from a traditional academic program, Blair explained.</p>\n<p>With a background in recruiting companies to the U.S. and training, Blair had first-hand exposure to what he called a sister company located in Singapore, Red Alpha, that started four years ago. NukuDo’s first training class began in March.</p>\n<p>Blair shared a recent conversation with a CISO, saying he thought a very significant portion of his workforce in dealing with cybersecurity could only follow a checklist of things to do.</p>\n<p>“That is not really what the industry needs,” he said about filling the numerous digital security vacancies.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The training program he expanded from Red Alpha addresses that need. In Singapore, the facility has about 180 people who have successfully worked through its programs in the last four years. The facility’s amazing record is that it has placed 100% of the graduates.</p>\n<p>Blair said he had 5,000 applicants for his first training class in March. From that pool, he hired about 15 people. As the training cycle is wrapping up, all of those trainees are in the process of getting industry certifications.</p>\n<p>“So our acceptance rate is less than 1%, but that is really important because I can find the right people in that pool worth investing in,” he offered.</p>\n<h3>Aligning Training, Education, and Employment</h3>\n<p>Blair believes this cybersecurity training method works because it aligns three separate entities. There is an individual who wants to enter the industry, the education provider who knows they provide a skill set that employers want to hire, and the employer’s interest.</p>\n<p>Blair likened his operational process to following the military model. Who else will recruit, train, and give you your first job?</p>\n<p>“We have just found a way to make it work for the private sector. What is unique about me as an education provider is that I’m not in armed services,” he observed.</p>\n<p>He hires the selected trainees as employees for his company. He pays them a salary. As trainees, they agree to work for NukuDo for up to three years after the firm lands them that first job.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“So, it is what I would call a new co-employment model. I don’t have stock. I don’t sell software. What I do is bring the people to the companies and then let those companies essentially have what you could call the world’s longest job interview,” he reasoned.</p>\n<p>During this on-the-job experience, Blair is derisking their hiring process when it comes to cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>“They’re an employee with us. I pay them a salary. I pay them benefits. It’s an amazing arrangement,” he added.</p>\n<p>“I am still the W2 of record, meaning that our business partners — the companies where we place our employees — write us a check for our employees’ services. That’s a really nice arrangement for them. One check takes care of everything, and that includes professional development.”</p>\n<p>That happens every six months. Blair brings his hires back for a week at a time to upskill them. He is in touch with the employer company the entire time.</p>\n<h3>Complementing Traditional Cybersecurity Education</h3>\n<p>Blair sees his role as supporting the industry in finding the workhorses it says it is desperate to hire. NukuDo and Red Alpha are separate companies that differ somewhat in how they operate. No financial controls or fees exist between them.</p>\n<p>“We just happen to share a parent company more than anything else,” he noted.</p>\n<p>Blair is not trying to outdo traditional academic approaches to cybersecurity education. He thinks there will always be a place for university programs that teach and provide a good baseline for students to learn about things like governance.</p>\n<p>“But for us, it is really about giving our hires the operational skills that they are going to need to succeed when they hit the keyboard to defend and protect customer data,” he said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Data poisoning is a cyberattack where adversaries inject malicious or misleading data into AI training datasets. The goal is to corrupt their behavior and elicit skewed, biased, or harmful results. A related danger is creating backdoors for malicious exploitation of AI/ML systems.</p>\n<p>These attacks are a significant concern for developers and organizations deploying artificial intelligence technologies, particularly as AI systems become more integrated into critical infrastructure and daily life.</p>\n<p>The field of AI security is rapidly evolving, with emerging threats and innovative defense mechanisms continually shaping the landscape of data poisoning and its countermeasures. According to a report released last month by managed intelligence company <a href=\"https://www.nisos.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nisos</a>, bad actors use various types of data poisoning attacks, ranging from mislabeling and data injection to more sophisticated approaches like split-view poisoning and backdoor tampering.</p>\n<p>The Nisos report reveals increasing sophistication, with threat actors developing more targeted and undetectable techniques. It emphasizes the need for a multi-faceted approach to AI security involving technical, organizational, and policy-level strategies.</p>\n<p>According to Nisos senior intelligence analyst Patrick Laughlin, even small-scale poisoning, affecting as little as 0.001% of training data, can significantly impact AI models’ behavior. Data poisoning attacks can have far-reaching consequences across various sectors, such as health care, finance, and national security.</p>\n<p>“It underscores the necessity for a combination of robust technical measures, organizational policies, and continuous vigilance to effectively mitigate these threats,” Laughlin told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Current AI Security Measures Inadequate</h3>\n<p>Current cybersecurity practices underscore the need for better guardrails, he suggested. While existing cybersecurity practices provide a foundation, the report suggests new strategies are needed to combat evolving data poisoning threats.</p>\n<p>“It highlights the need for AI-assisted threat detection systems, the development of inherently robust learning algorithms, and the implementation of advanced techniques like blockchain for data integrity,” offered Laughlin.</p>\n<p>The report also emphasizes the importance of privacy-preserving ML and adaptive defense systems that can learn and respond to new attacks. He warned that these issues extend beyond businesses and infrastructure.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>These attacks present broader risks affecting multiple domains that can impact critical infrastructure such as health care systems, autonomous vehicles, financial markets, national security, and military applications.</p>\n<p>“Moreover, the report suggests that these attacks can erode public trust in AI technologies and exacerbate societal issues such as spreading misinformation and biases,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Data Poisoning Threatens Critical Systems</h3>\n<p>Laughlin warns that compromised decision-making in critical systems is among the most serious dangers of data poisoning. Think of situations involving health care diagnostics or autonomous vehicles that could directly threaten human lives.</p>\n<p>The potential for significant financial losses and market instability due to compromised AI systems in the financial sector is concerning. Additionally, the report warns the risk of erosion of trust in AI systems could slow the adoption of beneficial AI technologies.</p>\n<p>“The potential for national security risks includes vulnerability of critical infrastructure and the facilitation of large-scale disinformation campaigns,” he noted.</p>\n<p>The report mentions several examples of data poisoning, including the 2016 attack on Google’s Gmail spam filter that allowed adversaries to bypass the filter and deliver malicious emails.</p>\n<p>Another notable example is the 2016 compromise of Microsoft’s Tay chatbot, which generated offensive and inappropriate responses after exposure to malicious training data.</p>\n<p>The report also references demonstrated vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicle systems, attacks on facial recognition systems, and potential vulnerabilities in medical imaging classifiers and financial market prediction models.</p>\n<h3>Strategies To Mitigate Data Poisoning Attacks</h3>\n<p>The Nisos report recommends several strategies for mitigating data poisoning attacks. One key defense vector is implementing robust data validation and sanitization techniques. Another is employing continuous monitoring and auditing of AI systems.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“It also suggests using adversarial sample training to improve model robustness, diversifying data sources, implementing secure data handling practices, and investing in user awareness and education programs,” said Laughlin.</p>\n<p>He suggested that AI developers control and isolate dataset sourcing and invest in programmatic defenses and AI-assisted threat detection systems.</p>\n<h3>Future Challenges</h3>\n<p>According to the report, future trends should cause heightened concern. Much like with other cyberattack strategies, bad actors are fast learners and very handy at innovating.</p>\n<p>The report highlights expected advancements, such as more sophisticated and adaptive poisoning techniques that can evade current detection methods. It also points to potential vulnerabilities in emerging paradigms, such as transfer learning and federated learning systems.</p>\n<p>“These could introduce new attack surfaces,” Laughlin observed.</p>\n<p>The report also expresses concern about the increasing complexity of AI systems and the challenges in balancing AI security with other important considerations like privacy and fairness.</p>\n<p>The industry must consider the need for standardization and regulatory frameworks to address AI security comprehensively, he concluded.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The merger of two popular open-source communities could sharpen the focus on bolstering online privacy and web-surfing anonymity.</p>\n<p>The Amnesic Incognito Live System, or <a href=\"https://tails.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tails</a>, and the anonymity network <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tor Project</a>, short for The Onion Router, announced in late September a merger to unite operations and resources from both software communities into a single entity. The merger started in late 2023 when the Tails leadership needed a solution to having maxed out operational funds. Both entities decided to share the common goal of online anonymity.</p>\n<p>A joint statement explained that the merger solved expansion and operational issues for both parties. Tails developers could avoid independently expanding operational capacity by combining with the Tor Project’s “larger and established operational framework.”</p>\n<p>“By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of The Tor Project,” according to the announcement.</p>\n<p>The merger is significant as it unifies two similar projects, enhancing resources and efficiency in developing robust online privacy tools, according to Jason Soroko, senior fellow at <a href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sectigo</a>, a comprehensive certificate lifecycle management firm. He views this merger as substantially impacting privacy concerns by improving tools that better protect users from surveillance and data misuse.</p>\n<p>“Increased focus on internet privacy is essential, and open-source projects should lead in providing transparent, collaborative solutions to safeguard personal data,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<h3>Aligns Similar Project Goals</h3>\n<p>Tor and Tails are most often used together, noted Soroko. Tails is a live Linux operating system that routes all internet traffic through the Tor network by default. Tor routes traffic through multiple volunteer-operated nodes, making it much harder to trace.</p>\n<p>Tails, a free live operating system, ensures that no data is stored on the device after use, providing a secure environment that leaves no traces. This security measure is essential for users in high-risk situations, such as journalists, activists, or whistleblowers who need to protect their identities and activities from surveillance and censorship, he explained.</p>\n<p>Both organizations aim to protect users from surveillance and censorship over the internet. Tails already used the Tor network to enhance online privacy. The free Tor browser, a tool frequently used to navigate the dark web, remains hidden from visited websites to avoid third-party trackers and ads.</p>\n<p>Tor is an independent web browser that connects users to the internet through a proxy server, enabling anonymous connections from IP addresses that cannot be linked to a specific service or individual.</p>\n<p>Casey Ellis, founder and advisor at crowdsourced cybersecurity firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bugcrowd.com/\">Bugcrowd</a>, agreed that this is an interesting move that makes a lot of sense. Sharing the business infrastructure will free up the Tails team, and the core group will have the time and opportunity to focus on the evolving needs of a privacy-focused OS like Tails.</p>\n<p>“This merger involving an operating system such as Tails was long-awaited … Hopefully, this move broadens awareness of and contribution to the maintenance and improvement of both projects,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<h3>Could Put Enterprise and Personal Needs at Odds</h3>\n<p>In enterprises that approve web traffic monitoring for security and use of unapproved software and operating systems, this definitely will have privacy concerns. However, for legitimate and privacy-focused users, this will be a boon, offered Mayuresh Dani, manager of security research for the Threat Research Unit at <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qualys</a>.</p>\n<p>“Protection against the abuse of personal data should definitely be one of the topmost pillars in protecting enterprises,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>In today’s interconnected world, everyone has an app for everything. All these apps share data with their creators as analytics to improve their services or products.</p>\n<p>“Most of us are not aware of the information being collected at all. If a threat actor gains access to this personalized information, then a lot of attacks are possible,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Factors Driving Interest in Preserving Online Privacy</h3>\n<p>Growing concerns about internet data abuse are impacting both consumers and enterprises, suggested Arjun Bhatnagar, co-founder and CEO of privacy company <a href=\"https://www.cloaked.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cloaked</a>.</p>\n<p>“The demand for privacy as a response to a growing abuse of personal data is rapidly becoming one of the most important issues of our time,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>Strong interest is mounting in understanding how to tackle the abuse of data. This is prevalent with consumers actively disengaging by deactivating online accounts to businesses facing potential bankruptcy (e.g., 23andMe) due to reputation loss after a data breach.</p>\n<p>This growing privacy concern is rooted in high-profile data breaches, manipulative AI algorithms, misuse of data for targeted advertising, unethical data-sharing practices, and intrusive surveillance by governments and corporations, which are entering daily discourse among individuals, Bhatnagar detailed.</p>\n<p>He agreed that the merger, by uniting two trusted privacy tools, could strengthen efforts to protect users from surveillance and data exploitation.</p>\n<p>“With shared resources, the merged entity can offer an integrated, more robust defense against surveillance and data abuse,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Balancing Privacy Responsibilities in Data Collection</h3>\n<p>According to Bhatnagar, the privacy focus should be on ensuring transparency, accountability, and robust security practices, regardless of the model. As privacy threats increase, both open-source and proprietary solutions must commit to prioritizing user data protection.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, the priority should be creating solutions that empower users to maintain control over their data while minimizing the risks of exploitation and abuse,” he urged.</p>\n<p>While some in the business and technology industries push for software developers to take an active role in safeguarding online privacy, others in the software development field argue that resolving the abuse of personal data on the internet is above their pay grade.</p>\n<p>Decisions about personal data collection are typically made by product managers, who determine what data to collect, guided by relevant laws and guidelines.</p>\n<p>However, they are incentivized to collect as much as possible, argued <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbehlendorf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brian Behlendorf</a>, a technologist, computer programmer, and leading figure in the open-source software movement. He also is the general manager of the Open Source Security Foundation (OSSF).</p>\n<p>“Other business roles inside a typical company decide with whom and how to share data and then direct engineers to implement,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<h3>Software Devs Not Part of Privacy-Stealing Machine</h3>\n<p>Behlendorf argued that, in most cases, software developers are not usually empowered to create software that minimizes the collection or sharing of personal data. Their convictions about this might not outweigh their employers’ designs and mandates; he offered as a personal opinion.</p>\n<p>He emphasized that his comments do not represent OSSF (which is hosted by <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/\">The Linux Foundation</a>) nor affiliations with Mozilla or the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eff.org\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF).</p>\n<p>“On a personal level, software developers I know are as angry as average citizens are about the ways their data is being used today,” Behlendorf continued.</p>\n<p>Developers are even more sensitive to what happens beneath the user interface layer and the potential for that abuse, he added.</p>\n<h3>Expanding Privacy Access and Awareness</h3>\n<p>Tor helps ensure your web traffic is difficult for anyone, including nation-state actors, to trace. Tails helps lock down your local computing environment in ways that make it difficult for even government-sponsored actors to hack.</p>\n<p>Behlendorf noted that these are tools that average consumers could use, and the more consumer usage they get, the better. The most compelling use cases are for users engaged in sensitive work.</p>\n<p>People in the human rights and journalism communities already know about Tor, but a much smaller number know about Tails.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully, this merger helps that crowd with intense needs also start to use Tails and benefit from its security promises and reassures them that the organizations behind these two pieces are better resourced,” he offered.</p>\n<p>“More broadly, among the consumer public, I don’t see as much impact, though I hope it creates positive pressure among the more popular social network apps to be more secure by default.”</p>\n",

In September, for example, only 10 new apps were debuted.</p>\n<p>Citing numbers from analytics firm Appfigures, the Journal reported some 1,770 apps were available in the Vision Pro app store, although only 34% of those apps were built specifically for the Vision Pro.

Nearly a year after the iPhone’s introduction, it had 50,000 apps in the App Store, and Apple Watch had 10,000 apps within five months of launch.</p>\n<p>However, the Journal acknowledged that the iPhone and Apple Watch had lower price points and wider consumer appeal than the Vision Pro.</p>\n<p>It’s also more difficult to create apps for the AR/VR headset. “Developing for the Vision Pro means moving away from 2D app design and into an immersive, 3D interactive environment. It’s a new frontier, and porting existing apps isn’t a plug-and-play process,” explained <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thegodfatheroftech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Timothy Bates</a>, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint College of Innovation &amp; Technology.</p>\n<p>“Developers need to rethink user interfaces, user experiences, and how people interact with software in spatial computing. It’s a challenge, but one that brings exciting possibilities if done right,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Horse and Cart Problem</h3>\n<p>Bates asserted that it has been challenging for Apple to draw in a large pool of developers. “This is common with new platforms, especially ones as advanced as the Vision Pro,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“Developers are hesitant to invest heavily when there’s a small initial user base, and when developing for mixed reality requires them to rethink conventional app design,” he said. “The tech itself is cutting-edge, but that also means a steeper learning curve.”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s having trouble attracting smaller developers who have limited budgets and need to have a market that’s ready for monetization, which I do not believe the Vision Pro provides,” added Anshel Sag, a senior analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>“What it does provide for larger developers is familiarization with Apple’s spatial computing platform and the ability to optimize its data and workflows for future generations to be more affordable, lightweight, and refined.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, maintained that developers are not throwing their weight behind Vision Pro because sales volumes have been small. “The development community for Apple products is attracted to the mammoth volumes that they can get access to,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That’s certainly not true with Vision Pro.”</p>\n<p>“With new hardware, there is always a horse and cart problem,” added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“Developers don’t want to create programs unless there is a critical mass of users, and users don’t want to buy the hardware until there are apps they want to use,” he told TechNewsWorld. “To get over this, typically companies have to fund the first set of apps, but Apple is really cheap and doesn’t typically do this well enough, which has become a problem again in this instance.”</p>\n<h3>Will Apple Fund Vision Pro Developers?</h3>\n<p>Vena predicted that Apple might start funding developers to make sure applications with a winning value proposition, and that really shows off this stuff, come to market.</p>\n<p>“I can see them teaming up with some of the more high-profile developers to make sure those applications come to market,” he said. “My guess is you’re going to see Apple do that behind the scenes in a way that they haven’t had to do with the iPhone and iPad.”</p>\n<p>“There’s no doubt that Apple is playing the long game here,” added <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimsquires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jim Squires</a>, an XR and games consultant based in St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada.</p>\n<p>“We’ll see both consumers and creators engage more with Apple’s spatial computing efforts when the cost comes down with future iterations,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but if Apple wants to have a pipeline of must-use software ready for that day, they should be stacking the deck now — and that means loudly and publicly funding more developers to take the plunge. Creating something like a Vision Pro Creator Fund to spur interest among XR developers would be a step in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>Bates agreed. “Apple should absolutely invest in developers. They’ve done it before with new platforms, and Vision Pro is no different,” he said.</p>\n<p>“By providing development grants or partnering with established AR/VR developers, Apple could give the Vision Pro a much-needed boost,” he maintained. “If you want a thriving ecosystem, you have to ensure developers can take risks and innovate without worrying about the financial burden.”</p>\n<h3>Success Depends on Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Enderle contended that funding developers is generally a requirement for a device in this class to be successful. “Microsoft massively invested in apps for Windows 95 and for the Xbox, and both were successful,” he said.</p>\n<p>But Sag doesn’t believe Apple is ready to open its coffers to developers. “It should fund developers, but it won’t because it believes that it has the most premium platform and the most captive customers with the willingness to spend,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“I think Apple should’ve given some seed funding to smaller developers before it launched the headset, but at this point, it has decided to let market dynamics work their magic,” he added.</p>\n<p>Another way to encourage developers to create apps for Vision Pro is to open up the system, contended Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a global market research company. “Apple should embrace more open standards like OpenXR and WebXR that make developing across platforms easier and enable developers access to the most headsets.”</p>\n<p>“It could also make a more affordable headset since there is a limited number of users globally willing and able to spend $3,500 on any device, let alone one as niche as a mixed reality headset,” he added.</p>\n<p>Bates noted that Vision Pro has immense potential, but its success depends on the ecosystem around it. “Apple needs to ensure that developers feel incentivized to create groundbreaking apps that truly showcase the device’s capabilities,” he said. “It’s also essential to manage expectations — this is a forward-thinking product that will take time to mature, both in terms of hardware and software support.”</p>\n<p>“Apple’s taking a bold step into the future with Vision Pro,” he added, “but they’ll need to nurture the developer ecosystem and likely roll out more accessible versions to see widespread adoption.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AI advancements over the last two years have been nothing short of amazing. Initially driven by Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI, this wave has spread far and wide, leaving few firms out of this AI feeding frenzy.</p>\n<p>As with all initial technology advancements, most vendors are screaming, “You must deploy AI now!” However, they have little experience or understanding of AI yet, which is fueling a staggering failure rate approaching 90%.</p>\n<p>One exception is HP, which has been aggressively deploying and using AI internally. At HP’s Imagine event last month, we saw a better AI future focused not on deploying AI for its own sake but on developing detailed plans encompassing HP’s internal resources and an impressive number of partners to ensure that AI deployments will succeed.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about HP’s unique AI strategy, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week: the first AI-driven HP Envy printers that, thanks to AI, promise to accomplish your complex print jobs.</p>\n<h3>HP Hope Program Addresses 2 Key Issues</h3>\n<p>One of the programs announced at HP Imagine was the HP Hope program, which effectively kills two birds with one stone, or one PC in this case. This program addresses two problems. One is the excessive number of older PCs that still work but end up in landfills. The other problem is the huge number of people, old and young, in underdeveloped areas who can’t afford new PCs.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hoperecyclingfutures.hp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP Hope Recycling Futures</a> program provides buyers with a disposal option. When customers return an HP PC to HP, it is refurbished and sent out to people who need a PC but lack the funds to buy one. This process is not a single-cycle program; these refurbished PCs can be cyclically refurbished for several generations, much like schoolbooks are resold, so that fewer new machines have to be purchased, and fewer PCs make it into landfills or recycling shops while they still have substantial utility.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HOPE Recycling Futures - HP Global PC Donation Program for kids\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yvHkSe9bJag\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Since AI remains cloud-based, these refurbished PCs are fine for cloud AI access and the increased use of AI tools to monitor, manage, repair remotely, and protect via Wolf Security. The result provides solid improvements even though these PCs are older. In some cases, if not most, even refurbished PCs can often perform better in terms of reliability, security, and availability than new PCs that aren’t wrapped with HP’s increasing number of AI services.</p>\n<h3>3D Collaboration</h3>\n<p>HP and Google presented their <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-starline-hp-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Starline</a> effort, which is impressive. I’ve been following video communication with a passion ever since I saw my first videoconferencing system at Disneyland in the 1960s.</p>\n<p>One of the longstanding issues with videoconferencing technology, dating back to those early 1960s systems, is that speaking to someone on a screen just doesn’t feel natural. The 2D representation of the person diminishes the realism of the interaction. This lack of immersion often leads to the need for in-person meetings, especially for critical interactions like job interviews, performance reviews, collaborations, and relationship building — whether personal or professional.</p>\n<p>Project Starline allows for a 3D image of the person with whom you are speaking to expand out of the screen and join you visually in front of the monitor rather than within it. If you’ve seen those high-tech billboards where the image seems to jump away from the display, the experience is similar to that. You can even high-five the remote speaker — but this isn’t a tangible projection, so you can’t feel their hand, and it vanishes if you try to touch it.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The most realistic video calls ever | Project Starline Prototype\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/obuyCkotJ_s\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This technology is a new level of AI use. I call it “Remote Presence” because it makes the remote person feel you are in the room with them. It’s pretty amazing, and I expect this technology to eventually embrace future digital assistants, making them look more realistic without building a robotic body.</p>\n<h3>HP Wolf Security’s Enhanced AI</h3>\n<p>HP is also monitoring the use of AI in malware attacks and reports that while AI-driven attacks are still on the horizon, significant testing is underway, indicating bad actors are still learning how to use these tools.</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting yet troubling changes is embedding malware into SVG images on websites and online using XML. These attacks tend to install a significant number of scripts that infect devices by utilizing four or more distinct Trojan carriers. This shotgun-like approach significantly increases the likelihood of a successful infection, giving a hostile actor complete control of a PC.</p>\n<p>HP’s Wolf Security is being spun up to deal with these new aggressive threats. Still, with AI now being used to create them, the only defense able to mitigate or eliminate the problem will be one that uses an equally capable AI coupled with regular reminders to the employee to avoid clicking on surprise image files.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>This year, HP Imagine was awash with AI efforts, but the most powerful was HP’s effort to create, with partners, an approach to motivating employees to use these new tools. Often, users’ inability to even try new tools leaves the majority of them underutilized. HP is focusing its AI efforts on helping its business customers’ employees come up to speed rapidly with these AI tools so that firms gain the return on investment this class of tool promises.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a>This approach positively differentiates HP from companies like Dell, which mostly just throw products at the problem and do not work to ensure successful implementation. HP’s approach represents its relative maturity in that it is measured and focused on benefits, not just selling hardware and software to an inexperienced and somewhat naïve customer base still learning what AI can and cannot yet do.</p>\n<p>What continues to bleed through in events like this is HP’s unique focus on its customers, the environment, and doing what is right. I hope HP, unlike others, never loses that.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>HP Print AI</h3>\n<p>At its Imagine event, HP showcased two new All-in-One Envy Printers, the <a href=\"https://support.hp.com/hk-en/product/product-specs/hp-envy-6100e-all-in-one-printer-series/2101795615\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6100e</a> and the <a href=\"https://support.hp.com/ie-en/product/details/hp-envy-6500e-all-in-one-printer-series/2101795617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6500e</a>.

This means spreadsheets that look like spreadsheets and documents that otherwise wouldn’t fit the paper you are printing on will fit that paper. The AI analyzes your print job based on past training to determine the optimal format. Then, it auto-configures for that result so each print job is as perfect as the AI can make it, like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result.jpg\" alt=\"Excel HP print with AI result with corrected formatting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result-768x433.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Ironically, I ran into a problem when printing my “know before you go” report from HP for the event. My HP printer cropped both sides, blocking out the names and numbers I’d need should I run into problems (and I did run into problems).</p>\n<p>While I have a picture of the new and very nice HP Envy 6100e and 6500e printers at the top of this section, the print service is my Product of the Week because, like most of you, I’m tired of fighting my printer. The idea of it working well automatically is something I’ve been looking forward to for decades.</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The images featured in this article are credited to HP.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Not all Linux distributions provide platforms for enterprise and non-business adopters. <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> (RHEL) and the <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fedora Project</a> let users keep their Linux computing all in the family.</p>\n<p>Both the enterprise and community versions have upgraded over the last few weeks. RHEL is a commercial distribution available through a subscription and does not rely solely on community support. On the other hand, Fedora Linux is a free distro supported and maintained by the open-source community. In this case, Red Hat is the Fedora Project’s primary sponsor.</p>\n<p>However, independent developers in the Fedora community also contribute to the project. Often, Fedora Linux is a proving ground for new features that ultimately become part of the RHEL operating system.</p>\n<p>While Fedora caters to developers and enthusiasts, RHEL focuses on delivering enterprise-grade solutions. What’s the difference? Each edition caters to the needs of users’ business or consumer goals. Of course, using Fedora comes at a great price: it is free to download.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 13, Red Hat released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 with improved functionality in deploying applications and more effectively managing workloads across hybrid clouds while mitigating IT risks from the data center to public clouds to the edge. Matt Miller, the Fedora Linux project leader, announced the release of Fedora 41 on Oct. 29.</p>\n<h3>Meet the Latest RHEL</h3>\n<p>According to global market intelligence firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, organizations struggle to strike a balance between maintaining their Linux operating system environments and their workloads, which are hampered by time and resource constraints. The proliferation of the cloud and next-generation workloads such as AI and ML worsen their computing productivity.</p>\n<p>RHEL standardization increased the agility of IT infrastructure administration management teams by consolidating OSes, automating highly manual tasks such as scaling and provisioning, and decreasing the complexity of deployments. As a result, infrastructure teams spent 26% more time on business and infrastructure innovation, Red Hat noted.</p>\n<p>RHEL 9.5 delivers enhanced capabilities to bring more consistency to the operating system underpinning rapid IT innovations. This impacts the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in edge computing to make these booming advancements an accessible reality for more organizations.</p>\n<p>Enterprise IT complexity is growing exponentially, fueled by the rapid adoption of new technologies like AI. This growth affects both the applications Red Hat develops and the environments in which they operate, according to Gunnar Hellekson, VP and GM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>\n<p>“While more complexity can impact the attack surface, we are committed to making Red Hat Enterprise Linux the most secure, zero-trust platform on the market so businesses can tackle each challenge head-on with a secure base at the most fundamental levels of a system. This commitment enables the business to embrace the next wave of technology innovations,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<h3>Stronger Security and Compliance Management</h3>\n<p>The release includes a collection of Red Hat Ansible Content subscriptions that automate everyday administrative tasks at scale. The latest version also adds several new system roles, including a new role for sudo, a command-line utility in Linux, to automate the configuration of sudo at scale.</p>\n<p>By leveraging this capability, users can execute commands typically reserved for administrators while proper guardrails ensure rules are managed effectively. With automation, users with elevated privileges can implement sudo configurations securely and consistently across their environments, helping organizations reduce complexity and improve operational efficiency.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Increased platform support for confidential computing enables data protection for AI workloads and lowers the attack surface for insider threats. By preventing potential threats from viewing or tampering with sensitive data, confidential computing allows enterprises to have more opportunities to use AI more securely to review large amounts of data while still maintaining data segmentation and adhering to data compliance regulations.</p>\n<p>The Image Builder feature advances a “shift left” approach by integrating security testing and vulnerability fixes earlier in the development cycle. This methodology delivers pre-hardened image configurations to customers, enhancing security while reducing setup time. The benefit of these built-in capabilities is the ability to configure without being security experts.</p>\n<h3>Reduced Automation Complexity</h3>\n<p>Management tools simplify system administration. Users can automate manual tasks, standardize deployment at scale, and reduce system complexities.</p>\n<p>New file management capabilities in the web console allow routine file management tasks without using the command line, simplifying actions such as browsing the file system, uploading and downloading files, changing permissions, and creating directories.</p>\n<p>Another benefit addresses cloud computing storage. Container-native innovation at the platform level fully supports Podman 5.0, the latest version of the open-source container engine. It gives developers a powerful tool for building, managing, and running containers in Linux environments.</p>\n<p>According to Greg Macatee, research manager for infrastructure software platforms and worldwide infrastructure research at IDC, companies using the new RHEL release validated that the platform simplified management while reducing overall system complexity.</p>\n<p>“They also noted that it radically reduced the time required for patching while simplifying kernel modifications and centralizing policy controls. They further called out the value of automation, better scalability, and access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux expertise,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<h3>Added Support Key to Enterprise</h3>\n<p>Application streams provide the latest curated developer tools, languages, and databases needed to fuel innovative applications. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 includes PG Vector for PostgreSQL, new versions of node.js, GCC toolset, Rust toolset, and LLVM toolset.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>While Java Dev Kit (JDK) 11 reached its end of maintenance in RHEL 9, this new release continues supporting customers using it. The new default JDK 17 brings new features and tools for building and managing modern Java applications while maintaining backward compatibility to keep JDK upgrades consistent for applications and users.</p>\n<h3>Highlighting the Fedora Community Release</h3>\n<p>The Fedora Project calls its community operating system <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/en/workstation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fedora Workstation</a>. It provides a polished Linux OS for laptop and desktop computers and a complete set of tools for developers and consumers at all experience levels.</p>\n<p>Fedora Server provides a flexible OS for users needing the latest data center technologies. The community also has Fedora IoT for foundation ecosystems, Fedora Cloud edition, and Fedora CoreOS for container-focused operations.</p>\n<p>According to Miller’s announcement in the online Fedora Magazine, Fedora 41 includes updates to thousands of packages, ranging from tiny patches to extensive new features. These include a new major release of the command-line package management tool, DNF (Dandified YUM), which improves performance and enhances dependency resolution.</p>\n<p>The Workstation edition offers various desktop environment options, known as spins, including Xfce, LxQt, and Cinnamon. It also introduces a new line of Atomic-flavored desktops, which streamline updates by bundling them into a single image that users install, eliminating the need to download multiple package updates.</p>\n<p>Fedora Workstation 41 is based on Gnome 47. One of its main changes is its customization potential. In the Appearance setting, you can change the standard blue accent color of Gnome interfaces, choosing from an assortment of vibrant colors. Enhanced small-screen support helps users with lower-resolution screens see optimized icons scaled for easier interaction and better visibility on smaller screens, and new-style dialogue windows enhance usability across many screen sizes.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple’s flavor of generative artificial intelligence, called Apple Intelligence, was laced throughout its latest watch, AirPods, and phone offerings, announced at its “Glowtime” event on Monday.</p>\n<p>Speakers at the prerecorded session aired online touted a number of features in the new hardware lineup, which uses Apple Intelligence to support everything from diagnosing sleep apnea to addressing hearing loss to managing a phone’s bloated photo library.</p>\n<p>“Apple is trying to embed AI into everything,” observed Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“They did all the things they had to do,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They upgraded the watch, the AirPods, the phones and their cameras, but everything they led with, in every product category, was all about AI, AI, AI, AI.”</p>\n<p>Gene Munster, managing partner at <a href=\"https://deepwatermgmt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deepwater Asset Management</a>, a venture capital firm in Minneapolis, noted that at the Apple event, there were a lot of details aired — features, pricing, timing.</p>\n<p>“That’s all noise,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It’s noise because it’s a trap to think about Apple Intelligence as a series of features.”</p>\n<p>“The reality is this is a new paradigm that will change how about 1.8 billion Apple customers interact with tech,” he declared.</p>\n<p>“In 2007,” he continued, “the iPhone’s touch screen was disguised as a feature, and in reality, it was the underpinnings of a paradigm shift of the phone becoming a computer in your pocket.”</p>\n<p>“Apple Intelligence puts infinite simplicity and intelligence in your pocket,” he said. He argued that Apple will provide the most usable version of consumer AI. “That’s because there is a hardware, software services element that only Apple can do,” he noted.</p>\n<h3>New Sleep Apnea App</h3>\n<p>At its online event, Apple announced its new Apple Watch Series 10. Its models are slimmer, with 30% larger displays, and their cases are made of aluminum and polished titanium. The watch is powered by a new S10 SiP, has a new sleep apnea feature, and has an 18-hour battery life. Models start at US$399 and will be available on Sept. 20.</p>\n<p>“I think that the larger display is going to drive a lot of people to upgrade,” predicted Anshel Sag, a senior analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>“You might even see some people move from the Ultra to the new Series 10 just because of the bigger screen,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Thinner and lighter design is nice, but I think ultimately people are really about having bigger screens on their wrist. It ends up being more useful. As long as the bigger screen doesn’t affect battery life, I think people prefer that larger display.”</p>\n<p>“The new series also has a better viewing angle,” he added. “That’s important, too, because you’re not always looking at your wrist head-on.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-wide-angle-OLED-display.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series-10 wide-angle OLED display\" width=\"1000\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-wide-angle-OLED-display.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-wide-angle-OLED-display-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-wide-angle-OLED-display-768x452.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The wide-angle OLED display on the Apple Watch Series 10 improves visibility at wider angles and is up to 40 percent brighter than the Series 9 when viewed from the side.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tim Bajarin, president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativestrategies.com/\">Creative Strategies</a>, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif., praised the new sleep apnea feature. “Any person that has sleep apnea, especially significant sleep apnea, can have serious health problems,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The ability to test for sleep apnea during a normal sleep pattern is quite important.”</p>\n<p>“That information can be taken to the doctor who will look at that test and that sleep pattern and start the process of determining how serious the sleep apnea is,” he added.</p>\n<p>Apple also released updates to the Apple Watch Ultra 2, featuring a new titanium case and sapphire front crystal. Models start at $799 and will be available Sept. 20.</p>\n<h3>Refreshed AirPods</h3>\n<p>Apple also refreshed its AirPods line. It improved the audio performance in its AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, introduced new colors for its over-the-ear AirPods Max offering, and upgraded its AirPods Pro product. AirPods 4 sell for $129 and $179 with active noise cancellation. AirPods Max sells for $549, and AirPods Pro 2 for $249. All are available on Sept. 20.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-AirPods-lineup.jpg\" alt=\"AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation, AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Max\" width=\"1000\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-AirPods-lineup.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-AirPods-lineup-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Apple-AirPods-lineup-768x398.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>From left to right: The new AirPods lineup features AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Max. This refreshed lineup includes updated designs for AirPods 4, new color options for AirPods Max, and integrated hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“I was shocked that Apple spent so little time on the AirPods Max,” Vena said. “They haven’t upgraded those over-the-head headphones for a long time. I’ve been using mine for several years. The only change they made was switching from the Lightning plug to USB-C.”</p>\n<p>With the new AirPods Pro 2 line, Apple is entering the hearing health business. The AirPods Pro cannot only perform hearing tests but also act as hearing aids.</p>\n<p>“They didn’t spend a lot of time on the ability to do a hearing test, but it is a big deal,” Bajarin maintained.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people understand they might have a little bit of hearing loss, but they don’t really know how significant it is. With this new software, they can actually do a hearing loss test. And that’s quite important because, right now, if you have to do a hearing test, you’ve got to go into a doctor’s office or to an audiologist and take a test in person. Having that on your phone simplifies the process,” he noted.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“The software can also turn the AirPods Pro into a clinically approved hearing aid,” he continued. “What is really important to understand — and I think is going to make the AirPods big, big sellers — is that they can take away the stigma behind hearing aids.”</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of people who hesitate to use a hearing aid because it identifies them with a medical problem,” he explained. “Well, if you’re wearing the new AirPods Pro and you’re using them at the hearing aid level, nobody knows that. They’re just thinking that you’re listening to music, and it takes away that stigma.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s a game-changer,” he added. “I think it alone will cause many more people to check their hearing and utilize this kind of a solution, which is much cheaper than most of the hearing aids on the market and makes it a much more accessible health tool in the process.”</p>\n<h3>Smarter Siri</h3>\n<p>The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are based on the new A18 chip, while the A18 Pro powers the Pro and Max models.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-color-options.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 16 color options:  black, white, pink, teal, and ultramarine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-color-options.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-color-options-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-color-options-768x476.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be available in five colors: black, white, pink, teal, and ultramarine.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“It’s important for developers that the A18 is used in all the iPhone 16 models,” Sag said. “There’s no longer this two-tiered strategy anymore. I think it will help to consolidate what features are and aren’t supported on the silicon.”</p>\n<p>“The A18 Pro chip has the most powerful neural processing engine the iPhone has ever had,” Bajarin noted. “It’s critical to process the kind of data you need for generative AI. So the A18 Pro chip makes the iPhone 16 the most powerful artificial intelligent enhanced smartphone on the market today.”</p>\n<p>“And it allows Siri to be much smarter, to not only give you data but also analyze the data,” he said. “It lets you look at your photo library and quickly determine all the pictures you’ve ever taken of your dog or create albums for you automatically.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-finish-lineup.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 16-Pro finish-lineup: black titanium, natural titanium, white titanium, and desert titanium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-finish-lineup.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-finish-lineup-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-finish-lineup-768x476.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available in four finishes: black titanium, natural titanium, white titanium, and desert titanium.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Siri may be smarter, but it might not be a world changer. “I don’t think Siri is yet a new interface that will change how we interact with the world around us,” observed Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester Research</a>, a market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.</p>\n<p>“However, there are clear signs that Siri is finally moving into becoming more of a digital agent leveraging your on-device information and personal context to deliver new multimodal experiences and take actions on your behalf,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Several camera upgrades were made to the iPhone 16, including a camera control button, a 48MP fusion camera, and the equivalent of four lenses. The iPhone 16 sells for $799; 16 Plus, $899; 16 Pro, $999; and 16 Pro Max, $1,199. The phones will be available on Sept. 20.</p>\n<p>According to Apple, some hefty trade-in amounts for iPhone 12 and above can be used to buy an iPhone 16. “They want a good upgrade cycle that moves more people to Apple intelligence-capable devices,” Sag said.</p>\n<p>“I think they want there to be a robust Apple Intelligence installed base so that they can convince developers to build to it,” he added. “They’re banking quite a bit of the company’s success on Apple Intelligence being supported by developers in a coherent and capable way.”</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The images featured in this article are credited to Apple.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>In the ever-evolving world of technology, 2024 brought some exciting innovations alongside an alarming number of trends that expose the pitfalls of our current tech culture.</p>\n<p>From overhyped AI gimmicks to privacy erosion and unsustainable hardware practices, here are some of the worst tech trends of 2024 that have frustrated consumers and industry leaders and are unlikely to abate next year.</p>\n<h3>1. Proliferation of Useless AI Tools</h3>\n<p>Generative AI dominated 2023, but by 2024, the trend spiraled into absurdity. Countless companies have rolled out AI-powered tools that address non-existent problems — or create entirely new ones.</p>\n<p>AI now generates everything from poorly edited videos and unintelligible blog posts to automatically written emails that require human intervention to fix. Tools that claim to offer productivity boosts often result in inefficiencies because of their flawed outputs.</p>\n<p>The flood of low-quality AI products has undermined trust in genuinely helpful AI innovations. Small businesses and consumers alike are overwhelmed by tools with overblown marketing promises.</p>\n<p>Many of these deficient AI solutions add another layer of automation without offering real value. This overproduction has created noise, making distinguishing truly transformative tools from mere gimmicks harder.</p>\n<h3>2. Decline of Digital Privacy</h3>\n<p>Former Oracle CEO Larry Ellison once famously said, “Privacy is Dead.” However, privacy has been resurrected and killed more times than a Tyrannosaurus Rex in a “Jurassic Park” sequel.</p>\n<p>Digital privacy continues to erode in 2024 as big tech companies push the boundaries of data collection under the guise of personalization. This year, the rise of AI-driven surveillance tools has become particularly concerning. Facial recognition is now integrated into everything from retail stores to public transportation systems without sufficient regulation or oversight.</p>\n<p>Hyper-targeted ads across platforms and connected technologies have reached a tipping point. New technologies scrape data from various devices at unprecedented levels, often without users’ consent or precise opt-out options. For instance, smart home devices have increasingly come under fire for tracking conversations and usage patterns far beyond their intended purpose.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most worrying is the resurgence of the “we’re improving your experience” excuse. Tech companies increasingly bypass GDPR-like protections by using convoluted terms of service agreements that make opting out prohibitively tricky. This unfortunate phenomenon sets a dangerous precedent for future interactions between consumers and technology.</p>\n<h3>3. Tech Subscription Fatigue</h3>\n<p>Most tech users will identify with this trend. In 2024, the “everything-as-a-service” model has reached absurd new heights.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>From software to hardware, companies are turning more and more products into monthly subscriptions. Consumers are now paying subscriptions for products that were traditionally one-time purchases: car manufacturers charging for heated seats, printers requiring monthly fees to unlock ink usage, and even smart home locks demanding ongoing payments to access advanced features.</p>\n<p>The subscription model has become synonymous with monetizing basic functionality. What started with streaming platforms has now spread to nearly every product category. It has become overwhelming, financially unsustainable, and increasingly frustrating for many consumers. Companies risk alienating their customer base by prioritizing recurring revenue over user experience.</p>\n<h3>4. Return of Vaporware and Overpromises</h3>\n<p>Tech companies have revived a troubling trend of overhyping products that don’t exist in usable forms. This year has been marked by grand promises of game-changing devices and services that either underdeliver or never materialize.</p>\n<p>One example is the push for <em>AI PCs</em>, where marketing campaigns tout devices with unmatched capabilities that remain largely theoretical. Similarly, augmented reality (AR) platforms have made headlines, yet most consumers still lack meaningful use cases beyond demo videos and niche applications.</p>\n<p>This trend mirrors the vaporware hype of the early 2000s, where buzzwords like “digital transformation” were attached to half-baked products. In 2024, buzzwords such as “quantum-ready” and “AI-powered” are increasingly slapped onto underdeveloped offerings to ride the tech wave, undermining consumer trust.</p>\n<p>While I am optimistic about the rise of PCs (both Windows and Mac, x86, Arm or Apple Silicon-based) with integrated AI technology at the silicon level, the jury is still out if mainstream consumers have drunk the AI Kool-Aid.</p>\n<h3>5. E-Waste From Unnecessary Upgrades</h3>\n<p>The unsustainable tech upgrade cycle will worsen in 2025. Major hardware manufacturers continue to push minor annual refreshes of devices while retiring older models earlier than necessary. Smartphones, laptops, and wearables now seem designed for obsolescence, forcing users to replace functional devices far too soon.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This approach has generated alarming levels of electronic waste. Consumers face limited repair options as companies lock down parts and restrict third-party fixes, leading to devices being thrown away rather than repaired. Additionally, the push for disposable devices contradicts the industry’s public commitments to sustainability.</p>\n<p>In parallel, new hardware launches often emphasize gimmicky features, like foldable screens or AI-generated wallpapers, that offer little utility. Meanwhile, genuine performance improvements are increasingly incremental, leaving users questioning whether upgrades are worth the cost.</p>\n<h3>6. Dystopian Applications of AI Surveillance</h3>\n<p>AI surveillance tools have seen rapid adoption, particularly in workplaces and schools. Employers increasingly turn to AI monitoring software to track productivity by analyzing keystrokes, screen activity, and facial expressions. This invasive approach erodes trust between employers and employees while normalizing intrusive surveillance practices.</p>\n<p>Similarly, schools have begun implementing AI tools to monitor students’ attention and behavior, often with flawed algorithms. These technologies reinforce punitive environments and disproportionately impact vulnerable communities. Critics argue that such systems prioritize control over genuine engagement or well-being.</p>\n<h3>7. Social Media’s Algorithmic Decline</h3>\n<p>Social media algorithms in 2024 have become worse than ever, prioritizing engagement metrics over quality content. Platforms are flooded with clickbait, misinformation, and sensationalized posts designed to keep users scrolling endlessly. Genuine connection — once the core promise of social media — has been replaced by a relentless pursuit of ad revenue.</p>\n<p>Adding insult to injury, platforms have ramped up the push for paid verification and algorithmic boosts, forcing creators to pay for visibility. This pay-to-play model exacerbates inequality in content discovery, pushing smaller creators to the margins.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: A Call for Responsible Innovation</h3>\n<p>While technology has the potential to improve lives, 2024 has brought forth trends that emphasize profit, surveillance, and short-term gains over long-term innovation and ethical considerations.</p>\n<p>From the glut of useless AI tools to worsening e-waste and dystopian surveillance practices, it’s clear that the tech industry needs a course correction.</p>\n<p>Consumers, regulators, and innovators alike must push for responsible, meaningful advancement since ignoring it will allow these trends to define the future of technology.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple MacBook Pro users often find it difficult to switch to Windows laptops due to the deep integration of the Apple ecosystem, which offers seamless connectivity between devices like iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Features such as AirDrop, Handoff, iMessage, and iCloud synchronization create a frictionless workflow that’s difficult to replicate on Windows.</p>\n<p>Additionally, macOS is known for its stability, optimized performance, and clean user experience, making the transition to Windows — where driver issues, inconsistent UI, and bloatware can be concerns — feel clumsy. Many MacBook Pro users are also heavily invested in Apple-exclusive software like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and macOS-specific productivity tools.</p>\n<p>Hardware aesthetics and longevity also play a role; Apple’s unibody aluminum design, high-resolution Retina displays, and industry-leading battery life set a high standard. Ultimately, switching from a MacBook to Windows isn’t just about a laptop — it’s about leaving an entire ecosystem that enhances convenience and productivity. But let’s focus on the laptop itself.</p>\n<p>Lenovo’s latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura Edition is giving me pause. The “Aura Edition” moniker signifies advanced AI features, including intelligent modes for privacy, productivity, distraction management, and premium customer support.</p>\n<p>It also highlights a powerful neural processing unit (NPU) within Intel’s latest Lunar Lake processor, delivering a more innovative and personalized user experience than standard Lenovo models.</p>\n<p>I don’t say this lightly. In the ever-evolving landscape of premium laptops, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 and Apple’s 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip stand out as top contenders. Both devices cater to professionals seeking performance, portability, and advanced features.</p>\n<p>However, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13, especially with Intel’s Lunar Lake processor marketed under the Core Ultra series, offers distinct advantages, making it a compelling choice for discerning users.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-front-view.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura Edition laptop front view\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-front-view.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-front-view-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-front-view-768x496.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura Edition features a lightweight design and vibrant display, making it a strong alternative to the MacBook Pro. (Photo by Author)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>ThinkPad vs. MacBook: Design and Build Quality</h3>\n<p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition continues Lenovo’s legacy of combining durability with elegance. Weighing a mere 2.17 pounds, it is notably lighter than many competitors, including the MacBook Pro. The X1’s carbon fiber and magnesium alloy construction ensure sturdiness without compromising on weight, making it exceptionally portable for professionals on the move.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip maintains Apple’s signature aluminum unibody design. While aesthetically pleasing and sturdy, it is considerably heavier than the ThinkPad at 3.3 pounds, which might be a consideration for users prioritizing ultra-lightweight devices — and that additional 1.1 pounds feels much heavier when you’ve been on the road for a few weeks.</p>\n<h3>Performance Showdown</h3>\n<p>At the heart of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 is Intel’s Lunar Lake processor, designed for efficiency and performance. It enables smooth multitasking and handles demanding applications with ease. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 features integrated Intel Arc Graphics 140V, providing solid performance for professional workloads and light creative tasks.</p>\n<p>The MacBook Pro’s M4 chip is built on a 3-nanometer process, delivering significant performance improvements over its predecessors. It excels in single-core tasks and provides solid performance for creative applications.</p>\n<p>However, for users who rely on software optimized for Windows or require specific enterprise solutions, the ThinkPad’s architecture may offer better compatibility and flexibility — especially since it’s x86-based. This reduces the risk of software compatibility issues, a potential concern with Arm-based laptops like those featuring the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip.</p>\n<h3>ThinkPad OLED vs. MacBook XDR: Display Quality</h3>\n<p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 features a stunning 14-inch 2.8K OLED display that delivers deep blacks, high contrast, and vivid colors. With HDR 500 certification and a 120Hz refresh rate, it offers smooth visuals and excellent clarity for both work and media consumption. The anti-glare, anti-reflection, and anti-smudge coatings enhance visibility, making it well-suited for varied work environments.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro features Apple’s Liquid Retina XDR display, known for its extreme brightness (1,000 nits sustained, 1,600 nits peak in HDR) and exceptional color accuracy. The M4 series improves glare reduction while maintaining high contrast and true-to-life colors, making it an excellent choice for creative professionals working in different lighting conditions.</p>\n<p>Both displays offer outstanding image quality, but the ThinkPad’s OLED panel excels in contrast, while the MacBook Pro’s XDR display leads in sustained brightness and color accuracy. Users prioritizing high peak brightness for HDR content may prefer Apple’s offering, while those seeking deep blacks and OLED vibrancy may lean toward the ThinkPad.</p>\n<h3>Battery Life and Charging</h3>\n<p>Battery performance is crucial for professionals on the go. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 stands out with respectable battery life, lasting through a typical workday under moderate use. While Apple’s MacBook Pro (and Air) with Apple Silicon set a high bar for battery endurance, Lenovo’s latest optimizations bring the X1 closer in efficiency, making it a more competitive option.</p>\n<p>While it may not surpass the MacBook Pro’s impressive battery life, the X1 compensates with rapid charging, minimizing downtime. The MacBook Pro with the M4 chip boasts extended battery life, often exceeding 16 hours for standard tasks. This longevity is beneficial for users who require prolonged unplugged use.</p>\n<h3>ThinkPad vs. MacBook Keyboard Experience</h3>\n<p>Lenovo’s ThinkPad series is renowned for its exceptional keyboards, and the X1 Carbon Gen 13 is no exception. It offers deep travel and tactile feedback, ensuring a comfortable typing experience. Additionally, the iconic TrackPoint provides an alternative navigation method, which many professionals appreciate.</p>\n<p>One huge plus for the ThinkPad is that it uses Lenovo’s TrackPoint for precise cursor control without lifting your hands off the keyboard, speeding up workflow for power users. Its small footprint doesn’t take up valuable trackpad space, making it perfect for confined spaces or on-the-go productivity. Plus, the tactile feel and responsiveness make it a favorite for those who prefer a more tactile navigation experience over a traditional trackpad.</p>\n<p>Apple’s MacBook Pro features the Magic Keyboard, which has been well-received for its improved key stability and responsiveness. While it provides a satisfactory typing experience, users who prefer deeper key travel might favor the ThinkPad’s keyboard.</p>\n<h3>Connectivity and Ports</h3>\n<p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 excels in connectivity options. It includes multiple USB-A and USB-C ports, HDMI, and a headphone jack, allowing users to connect various peripherals without needing adapters.</p>\n<p>While the MacBook Pro offers Thunderbolt ports, HDMI, and a headphone jack, it may require users to utilize adapters or dongles for USB-A and other connections, which can be less convenient for those with diverse peripheral needs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-left-side-ports.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura Edition laptop left side ports\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-left-side-ports.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-left-side-ports-300x120.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Aura-Edition-left-side-ports-768x307.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon’s left side includes one USB-A and two USB-C (Thunderbolt 4) ports, offering greater connectivity than most ultrabooks.

(Photo by Author)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Windows vs. macOS: Software and Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 runs on Windows, providing access to various software applications, particularly those tailored for enterprise environments. This compatibility is essential for professionals who rely on specific Windows-based tools.</p>\n<p>The MacBook Pro operates on macOS, which is known for its stability and seamless integration with other Apple products. While it supports a wide range of applications, some specialized software may not be available or optimized for macOS, which could be a limitation for specific professional workflows.</p>\n<h3>Price and Business Value</h3>\n<p>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13, starting at $2,267, is positioned as a premium device, reflecting its build quality, performance, and features. It offers substantial value for professionals seeking a lightweight, durable, and versatile laptop.</p>\n<p>The MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, which costs $2,199 when configured with similar storage and memory, also falls into the premium price bracket. While it delivers strong performance and battery life, users should consider whether its ecosystem and software compatibility align with their needs.</p>\n<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>\n<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 and the 14-inch Apple MacBook Pro with the M4 chip are formidable laptops catering to professionals.</p>\n<p>However, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 distinguishes itself with its ultra-lightweight design, superior keyboard and TrackPoint experience, diverse connectivity options, and the flexibility of the Windows operating system. These attributes make it a compelling choice for users seeking a reliable and versatile tool for their professional endeavors.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>While pricing is comparable, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon offers advantages such as frequent discounts from online retailers, customizable configurations, and enterprise-level security features tailored for business users.

      },
      "content": "<p>While artificial intelligence has juiced the marketing departments of smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, it isn’t generating much enthusiasm among users, according to a survey released Monday by a used electronics selling site.</p>\n<p>The survey by <a href=\"https://www.sellcell.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SellCell</a> of more than 2,000 iPhone and Samsung users found that 73% of iPhone and 87% of Samsung users said that the AI features on their phones added little to no value to their smartphone experience.</p>\n<p>Users’ low opinion of the AI on their phones reflects confusion in the market. “While companies are saying ‘now with AI’ or ‘AI included,’ they’re not telling users what to do with it,” said HP Newquist, executive director of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aiexhibit.org\">The Relayer Group</a>, a business consulting firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“They’re telling users, you now have access to AI. You can now use AI,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They’re just saying, here it is. You’ve got it now. And quite frankly, that’s not a compelling reason to use AI.”</p>\n<p>“We’re getting AI thrust at us, and I think consumers are completely nonplussed by that,” he observed.</p>\n<p>“We’re finding the same exact thing in corporate America,” he continued. “They’re getting told, you need to use generative AI. You need to use agentic AI. But they’re not being told how specifically it can benefit them. Until that’s made clear both at the consumer and the corporate level, you are going to have a fairly tepid response from first-time users.”</p>\n<h3>AI Not Well Understood</h3>\n<p>Privacy concerns may be dampening enthusiasm about AI among iPhone users, contended Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas. “Apple users have high expectations for data protection and skepticism about whether the features offer meaningful improvements beyond what competitors already provide,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Limited compatibility, with AI features likely restricted to newer iPhone models, may also alienate users of older devices,” he added.</p>\n<p>On the Samsung side of things, Vena continued, Galaxy AI lacks differentiation from other Android-based AI offerings, which may reduce excitement. “Samsung’s features might appear incremental rather than groundbreaking.”</p>\n<p>“Additionally, inconsistent user experiences with Samsung’s software and AI across devices could contribute to lower enthusiasm, compared to the more tightly integrated Apple ecosystem,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a market research firm in San Francisco, asserted that one of the central problems with Apple Intelligence is that it’s not well explained or well understood by the public. “Apple needs to do more to educate people about what the features are and when they will be available,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Tim Bajarin, president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativestrategies.com/\">Creative Strategies</a>, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif., agreed. “AI integration in smartphones is new and not well understood by the average user,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Google and Apple need to do more tutorial-like posts that show users the new AI features and how to use them.”</p>\n<p>“AI requires you to learn how to prompt, and it’s not easy,” added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“So we have a lot of training in front of us with regard to users knowing how to use this stuff,” he told TechNewsWorld. “I would expect the survey to be bad this early simply because Apple Intelligence hasn’t been available for very long, and people just don’t know how to use it yet.”</p>\n<h3>Long Rollout Dampens Exuberance</h3>\n<p>Sterling added that the multiple features clustered under the rubric Apple Intelligence are rolling out incrementally over time, so users haven’t really seen the concrete benefits yet. “In a year or two, I suspect this survey would have different outcomes,” he predicted.</p>\n<p>Will Kerwin, an equity analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago, also cited the drawn-out rollout of Apple Intelligence as a source of consumer apathy toward AI on their iPhones. “We believe it’ll take consumers time to fully bake in how Apple Intelligence is most useful to them and adapt personal habits,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“This all informs our view that Apple iPhone sales driven by AI will be stronger in fiscal 2026 than they are currently in fiscal 2025,” he said.</p>\n<p>Runar Bjørhovde, an analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.canalys.com/\">Canalys</a>, a global market research company, added: “The stark reality is that most people don’t buy phones because of AI. They buy because of different features.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“If we think of the type of features that AI has enabled, they are not that interesting right now,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It’s honestly not that surprising right now that AI features might disappoint people a bit because they’re not as advanced in reality as some of the marketing and messaging say they are,” he said.</p>\n<p>Bjørhovde maintained that many tech firms are having an “existential crisis,” where they’ve lost the huge hype and interest that people have had in them for the last 20 years.</p>\n<p>“They have to come up with new stories to try and get people interested,” he contended. “So, AI is a gold mine right now. I believe it can give us some really interesting innovations in a few years. But for now, it is this marketing bubble where people don’t actually know what to believe.”</p>\n<h3>Decline in Loyalty</h3>\n<p>The SellCell survey also found that about one in six iPhone users (16.8%) said they would consider switching to Samsung if it offered better AI features. In contrast, only 9.7% of Samsung users said they’d consider moving to Apple for better AI features.</p>\n<p>It added that the percentage of users loyal to Apple has declined from 92% in 2021 to 78.9% now. That compares to a decline from 74% to 67.2% over the same period for Samsung.</p>\n<p>“In general, the excitement around Apple’s annual upgrade cycle has declined a lot,” said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“These AI features are an attempt to inject something new and exciting into the experience,” he told TechNewsWorld. “But consumers are looking for a baseline of functionality and don’t think the platform is as much of an issue anymore.”</p>\n<p>Still, the finding that so many Apple users might be willing to jump ship for AI is surprising, he acknowledged. “Apple users just tend to be far more likely to opt into Apple services,” he explained. “Because of the App Store investments, you can’t necessarily move all that stuff to another platform. So that makes the reported greater willingness to switch surprising.”</p>\n<p>However, not everyone sees Apple’s fan base as waning. “We don’t see brand loyalty slipping in our surveys,” Bajarin declared. “We expect Apple to have a blockbuster holiday season, with iPhone sales and drawing many ‘switchers’ to the Apple ecosystem.”</p>\n<p>“We also don’t think loyalty to Apple is going away,” Kerwin added. “In our view, iPhone users are significantly likely to remain iPhone users, and AI features are just another means of locking them into Apple’s ecosystem.”</p>\n",

Apple, by contrast, shipped 56.0 million units during the period, for a 17.7% share, compared to 54.1 million units and a 17.8% share in Q3 2023.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/top-5-smartphone-companies-2024Q3.jpg\" alt=\"chart of the top 5 smartphone companies in Q3-2024\" width=\"958\" height=\"765\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/top-5-smartphone-companies-2024Q3.jpg 958w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/top-5-smartphone-companies-2024Q3-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/top-5-smartphone-companies-2024Q3-768x613.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px\"></p>\n<p>“Samsung retained its market leadership despite a drop in the total number of units shipped,” IDC Vice President for EMEA Client Devices Francisco Jeronimo said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “the company continues to grow its share in the premium segment as the average prices increased in the quarter driven by a stronger mix of Galaxy AI-enabled models.”</p>\n<p>“The company started rolling out Galaxy AI features to other Samsung models and launched the new Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6 foldables with Galaxy AI, which contributed to a better performance in the premium segment,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“I think the improvement in AI capabilities is helping more mainstream smartphones look more attractive, and there’s an appetite for AI everywhere,” Anshel Sag, a senior analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Industry in Existential Crisis</h3>\n<p>Canalys Analyst Le Xuan Chiew noted that the gap between the top five vendors has narrowed, intensifying the competitive landscape.</p>\n<p>“Vendors are entering the holiday shopping season with solid momentum and cautious optimism, aiming to attract consumers who have postponed upgrading their devices in anticipation of deals during major events like 11.11 and Black Friday,” he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “the importance of effective resource planning cannot be overstated. While market conditions are improving, demand remains fragile as vendors face increasing global challenges in demand generation and regulatory hurdles, such as the EU’s eco-design directive.”</p>\n<p>“Effective supply chain management, maintaining healthy inventory levels, and optimizing sales and marketing fund allocation are becoming even more critical for market leadership.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Bjørhovde told TechNewsWorld that the smartphone industry is in an existential crisis now. “They have to try and find some attraction point that can pull some demand forward,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Right now, it’s all about generative AI,” he continued. “A big part of the reason why AI is a big topic is because that’s where a lot of smartphone vendors have their eyes on when it comes to finding new monetization opportunities.”</p>\n<p>“But people are not really understanding what a lot of these AI features are,” he maintained. “From an analyst’s side, there are a lot of really interesting developments that will lead to interesting products and solutions in two, three, maybe even four years’ time. For consumers right now, though, an AI feature is just a fancy editing tool. It’s not really something that hugely differentiates what a smartphone can do.”</p>\n<h3>Continued Growth in 2025 Projected</h3>\n<p>Bjørhovde explained that the smartphone market has become a tactical game. “It’s trying to attract switchers and finding opportunities for upselling to users in the face of a clear worldwide trend, which is that phones are being used longer,” he said.</p>\n<p>“As much as the goal is to drive people to upgrade, the opposite is happening,” he continued. “In the U.S., the carrier discounts or subsidies are not as strong anymore. So, actually finding some add-on features, new revenue streams, new opportunities, leaning in more to B2B in some cases, that’s really where most smartphone vendors are focused.”</p>\n<p>He added: “It is an industry that has moved from a concept of revolution into evolution. I think the industry is living with its own curse because from 2007 up to 2015, every release was always hugely exciting. There was always something unexpected. Now it’s not as exciting.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The urge to upgrade, however, is stronger at the low end of the market, he asserted. “Two or three years ago, if you bought a $150 phone, you’d probably get a 12-megapixel camera and a battery that would last you half a day, maybe a full day. Now, you can almost get 50 megapixels on the camera. You can have two or three days of battery life. So the upgrades happening in the budget segment are really quite dramatic right now.”</p>\n<p>Looking forward to 2025, Sag predicted that the market should grow in the low-single-digits, which is normal for a mature market.</p>\n<p>Bjørhovde also sees continued market growth. “I think we’re looking at a year and a half probably. And if Apple Intelligence starts to pick up some new features and become really interesting in a year’s time, that could be a driver to get more people to decide to upgrade at that point.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Ignite</a> is on this week. It’s the company’s massive event focused on IT professionals. While you can attend this event remotely, you should consider attending in person this year because I still see far more AI failures than successes. When AI is deployed successfully, it has a significant positive impact on productivity, yet quality appears to be going in the wrong direction. But not for everyone.</p>\n<p>Shows like Microsoft Ignite are full of information on products and services. The event is attended by many IT professionals in different industries, with varying levels of AI deployment and very different paths to success.</p>\n<p>With the intense focus on all things AI, and Microsoft Copilot being one of the most widely spread AI tools, being able to talk to the people who have been successful with this tool, which vendors they worked with to deploy it successfully, and what practices helped their success become golden knowledge.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about why this year’s Ignite is important not only to attend — but to attend in person. We’ll close with my Product of the Week: Bluesky, the social media platform I hear people are having the best success with as they move from Twitter/X.</p>\n<h3>The Value of Relationships</h3>\n<p>Building strong vendor and peer relationships is essential for AI success, especially when navigating the complexities of new technology like Microsoft Copilot, which appears to be the most successful AI offering in the market so far. It has enormous productivity-improving value to every product it enhances.</p>\n<p>Because Microsoft is a platform, tools, and cloud company, its tools tend to be relatively unfocused in terms of industry or geography. This broad applicability doesn’t preclude tuning; it indicates the tools can be useful to almost every company, from enterprises to small businesses.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>While smaller companies will likely use AI as a service, enterprises are increasingly likely to use tools hosted on their own hardware or in a hybrid approach where sensitive information is retained, AI is accessed on-premises, and less secure information and implementation that don’t require low latency can be cloud-deployed.</p>\n<p>The issue to address is that service providers, OEMs, and most companies trying to ramp up AI don’t know enough about it to succeed. However, the people who understand AI and have had successful AI deployments (particularly the early adopters Microsoft assisted) will be at Ignite. Meeting these experts could make a difference in whether you overspend on these tools and help avoid common mistakes by learning from the mistakes of others and being able to delineate the hype from reality.</p>\n<h3>Genuine Value vs. Exaggerated Claims</h3>\n<p>I learned this lesson a few decades ago when Microsoft held an event arguing that its Windows NT servers could replace mainframes. When I had a chance to talk to two of Microsoft’s reference accounts, it became clear that Windows NT wasn’t ready to replace mainframes for most organizations.</p>\n<p>The first indicated that it was working very well and had effectively replaced their mainframe, but also that had Microsoft not paid for the deployment, they’d never have been able to afford it.</p>\n<p>The second account didn’t have a lot of time to talk to me because their NT servers had gone down, and the CEO was pissed. The poor guy likely thought his job wouldn’t survive the result.</p>\n<p>Vendors tend to overpromise and underdeliver. Microsoft is better than many, but it has had this problem in the past. When it comes to AI, while Copilot is performant, it appears to have a significant adverse impact on quality, which is only a dealbreaker if you can’t mitigate it.</p>\n<p>At Ignite, you can learn from the early adopters where the hype matches reality and where it doesn’t and how to mitigate the damage from the latter. You don’t want to be that poor guy who was an early adopter and likely lost his job as a result. These people can help ensure that your initial AI implementations with Copilot are something you can be proud of, not something you’ll be hiding from.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft Partners</h3>\n<p>At Ignite, there are always a lot of Microsoft partners, and every one of them will tell you that they are the partners for you. But along with these vendors are their customers who have used their services and deployment teams. Even if an OEM or service provider has a successful process, given how rapidly they’ve had to ramp up, some teams know what they are doing, and some are learning on the job.</p>\n<p>Given that large language models (LLMs) cost around $100 million to develop, learning on the job can be incredibly expensive and embarrassing for the individuals or organizations that hire the teams tasked with training these models. Asking about not only the vendors IT professionals used successfully but also the specific teams they used can inform you which vendors are better than others and which vendor teams are better than others.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>I once met with an executive who correctly identified the best vendor for a specific task only to find that the team was unavailable. So, they passed and went with a different vendor who could provide their most successful team for the deployment. The effort’s result was successful, but it might not have been if he had not looked under the covers to ensure the competency of the vendor and the team that provided the critical service.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>AI is in the midst of a significant feeding frenzy. Most failed deployments appear to be primarily due to the immaturity of the tools, the inexperience of the vendors and customers, an excessive focus on productivity, and an inadequate focus on quality. This doesn’t mean that AI is crap. It isn’t, and it is working for an increasing number of companies.</p>\n<p>The problem is the inability to delineate between those products, tools, and vendors that are competent for your industry and company and those that are not. Because of Microsoft’s leadership in AI, Ignite is one of the few places to get the critical information you need to make better choices and ensure your expensive AI deployment is successful.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Bluesky</h3>\n<p>Since Elon Musk took over Twitter and renamed it X, many users have been looking for an alternative service. Mastodon and Meta’s Threads initially looked like good alternatives, but both products had issues.</p>\n<p>While capable, Mastodon was somewhat difficult to use and hasn’t lived up to being a Twitter replacement. Threads got a huge initial bump, but it fell off quickly because it lacked many of the features people relied on with Twitter. People still use both platforms, but they don’t seem to be the go-to replacement for Twitter/X.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179460\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179460\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/X-fighting-Bluesky.jpg\" alt=\"A visual comparison between X (formerly Twitter) and Bluesky\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/X-fighting-Bluesky.jpg 400w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/X-fighting-Bluesky-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179460\"><span>(Image by Author / Gemini)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a>, at least for now, has gained traction as a viable replacement. It is relatively easy to use, and more feature-rich than Threads initially was. I’m getting inquiries from all over the world on that platform this week as more and more people globally abandon or cut back on their use of Twitter to use Bluesky instead.</p>\n<p>Social media is a thing, and while it might be healthier not to spend as much time on it, Bluesky continues to be a much more balanced platform, one I and others feel safe using. It reminds me of the early days of Twitter when the tool was fun to use, and you didn’t end up wasting time in online arguments with people who seemed outright crazy.</p>\n<p>For me, Bluesky is safer, more fun to use, and less full of misinformation than Twitter. It appears to be the best Twitter alternative for now, so it’s my Product of the Week.</p>\n<div><em>The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ECT News Network.</em></div>\n",

      "content": "<p>AMD has made significant strides in AI. Last week, it announced that its first 1-billion parameter large language models are performing exceptionally well. Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su and with the help of CTO and Executive VP Mark Papermaster, AMD has done an admirable job of fast pivoting after Nvidia and OpenAI’s initial surprise success to create a credible generative AI solution.</p>\n<p>What makes this incredible is that it took Nvidia around 20 years to get where it is — and although Nvidia clearly plowed the AI field, AMD is planting AI seeds like crazy. While this might be considered a risk to Nvidia’s growth, demand for AI solutions remains high and largely unmet. In a rapidly expanding market, all major players can benefit, and both AMD and Nvidia are well-positioned to succeed.</p>\n<p>In addition, the U.S. is pushing for AMD and Intel to merge, which could remove a lot of the marketing inefficiencies in the x86 space and allow both firms to better compete in the growing battle for AI dominance, in which China represents the most significant competitive threat.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about AMD’s AI progress and its potential merger with Intel. We’ll close with my Product of the Week: Google Gemini Advanced, which has proven incredibly helpful in creating &nbsp;images to accompany my writing.</p>\n<h3>AMD and AI</h3>\n<p>Nvidia caught the tech market with its pants down when it became clear that it was the technology behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform that was, in turn, the foundation for Microsoft Copilot. While Microsoft did a relatively poor job launching Copilot+, Copilot has been immensely successful, particularly with developers. Given that Nvidia took around two decades to build its incredible AI platform, it seemed unlikely that anyone would be able to compete with it for a few years.</p>\n<p>Well, AMD clearly didn’t get that memo. To catch up with Nvidia, AMD bought a company called Silo AI, known for its extensive pool of AI experts, rivaling even IBM. Silo AI was already amassing a number of successful AI projects in a market currently more defined by unsuccessful projects.</p>\n<p>AMD’s methodical approach to AI has been refreshing in a market where many players seem to be selling “solutions” that fall short. Sadly, this is the nature of a new tech market darling. People are so desperate to get it they aren’t looking under the covers hard enough. The result is an unusually high failure rate.</p>\n<p>However, both AMD and Nvidia are providing well-curated solutions. Nvidia built its capabilities largely organically, while AMD has done it faster through acquisition (given Nvidia was a first mover, this option wasn’t available to it in time).</p>\n<p>Much like AMD has always been a strong competitor to Intel and is an even stronger one today, it has also become an impressively strong peer to Nvidia as both companies move aggressively on this massive AI growth opportunity.</p>\n<h3>AMD and Intel May Merge</h3>\n<p>Currently, AMD is also outselling Intel in the data center space, which most of us thought was impossible. This shift showcases the difficulty Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger faces as he tries to turn around the company, partly by navigating the Chips Act to build a massive U.S. microprocessor manufacturing capability, a strategic imperative for both Intel and the U.S. Government.</p>\n<p>Intel is one of the “too big to fail” companies from a national security perspective, so the U.S. government is pushing for an AMD/Intel merger where AMD would manage the combined companies while manufacturing would spin out as a separate entity.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Gelsinger would likely run the manufacturing spin-out, giving Lisa Su the resources to better compete with the threat represented by China, especially Huawei, a company that has overcome U.S. sanctions to challenge Apple, among others. Huawei is considered one of the AI challengers to Nvidia and, by extension, AMD and Intel.</p>\n<p>This combination would significantly improve both x86’s prospects by eliminating unneeded competition between AMD and Intel — both of which are facing challenges from Arm, China, and Huawei — and allow greater focus on the strategic U.S. effort to build up domestic processor manufacturing.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>There is a lot of change going on in the tech space. Companies are flocking to AI solutions like nothing I’ve ever seen. The AI ramp-up and competitive dangers are pronounced. The U.S., while currently in the lead, is being approached rapidly by China, which is executing well with better government support than the U.S. has been able to create yet. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>AMD has stepped up to this competition behind Nvidia and is performing impressively well — and not just with AI. Its primary processor business is doing so well that it’s being asked to buy and merge with Intel’s development side and spin out manufacturing so it can advance more quickly with greater focus.</p>\n<p>While we often hold up Nvidia as the gold standard for AI computing, AMD is moving up fast as an alternative, and the market needs alternatives. It’s growing too fast for one or even two primary vendors. Lisa Su’s team continues to do impressive work, and I can only imagine the success they will likely enjoy in 2025.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Google Gemini Advanced</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Gemini-Advanced-creation.jpg\" alt=\"Gemini Advanced image\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Gemini-Advanced-creation.jpg 400w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Gemini-Advanced-creation-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Gemini-Advanced-creation-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"></p>\n<p>I use several AI products at the moment, one of which is Google Gemini. There are two forms of Gemini: The base form is free, and Gemini Advanced costs around $20 monthly.</p>\n<p>While I initially struggled a bit learning how to state prompts to create images I wanted properly, both Gemini Advanced and I have improved over time. It now only takes me one or two iterations to create an image to complement my writing.</p>\n<p>I’ve found Gemini Advanced to be incredibly fun to mess around with. For instance, I created the image shown here with the prompt, “generate an image of a beautiful anime girl in a flying car fighting a horrific monster in space.”</p>\n<p>The thing about AI tools is that they need to be fun and rewarding to use because there is a bit of a learning curve in how you phrase prompts — and each tool requires slightly different phrasing. Gemini Advanced is clearly a kid-friendly, G-rated tool, so it’s a bit safer than some of the others that don’t have guardrails.</p>\n<p>I’m having great fun with Google Gemini Advanced, so it’s my Product of the Week. You should <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out the free version</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A near-production model of a solar-powered car will be on display at CES 2025.</p>\n<p>Aptera Motors has announced that a “production intent” version of its eponymously named solar-powered vehicle will be displayed at the mammoth consumer electronics show, which will be held January 7-10 in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>The Aptera offers up to 40 miles of solar-powered driving per day, a three-wheel futuristic design, unparalleled energy efficiency, and the option to plug in for 400 miles on a single charge in under an hour, according to the company.</p>\n<p>“Announcement of a production-intent model means Aptera has a vehicle that should comply with regulatory requirements and should be at a level where the design is viable for manufacturing, hitting performance, safety, and manufacturing requirements,” Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Aptera is being watched with a great deal of interest by many in the automotive industry,” added Edward Sanchez, a senior analyst in the automotive practice at <a href=\"https://www.techinsights.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechInsights</a>, a global technology intelligence company.</p>\n<p>“It is a radical departure from most mainstream cars,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There’s a big question of demand and mainstream appeal for such an unconventional design.”</p>\n<p>“The company is also using some manufacturing techniques that, up to this point, have been mainly used in the supercar and motorsports industries,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“The company is targeting a competitive price point for its vehicle, so it will be interesting to see how these specialized techniques and materials will scale for what’s intended to be a quasi-mass-market vehicle — from a volume standpoint — and if the company can maintain competitive operating margins over the longer term.”</p>\n<h3>Demo Under Scrutiny</h3>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a>, a consulting and research firm in Las Vegas, maintained that the scrutiny around Aptera’s demo will be incredibly high. “The introduction of a production-intent vehicle signals that Aptera is transitioning from the prototype phase to a model ready for mass manufacturing, a critical milestone in its development,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“This step demonstrates the company’s confidence in the design, functionality, and manufacturability of the vehicle, aligning with industry standards and regulatory requirements,” he continued. “It also helps build consumer and investor trust by showcasing a tangible product that is nearing market readiness, setting the stage for final testing, production scaling, and eventual delivery. I’m not optimistic.”</p>\n<p>However, that dearth of optimism doesn’t seem to be shared by the early adopters who have forked over US$1.7 billion to pre-order 50,000 units of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>“CES is the perfect stage for unveiling the future of sustainable transportation,” Aptera Co-CEO Chris Anthony said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Our production-intent vehicle is not only a testament to years of innovation and engineering but also a tangible solution to reducing carbon emissions and redefining how we think about energy-efficient mobility. We’re excited to show the world that Aptera is ready to hit the road and deliver a cleaner, more sustainable future.”</p>\n<p>To secure that future, though, will require surmounting some significant challenges. “Generally, there just isn’t enough surface area on a car for the current solar panel technology to do more than just run HVAC to keep the car cool,” Enderle explained. “Recharging the massive batteries in most EVs would take days to weeks to recharge using panels on a car.”</p>\n<h3>Power Problem</h3>\n<p>Ben Zientara, a solar policy and industry expert at <a href=\"https://www.solarreviews.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SolarReviews</a>, a reviews and advice website, asserted that there is no way to power the kind of vehicle people want to drive with solar cells embedded in a car’s surface.</p>\n<p>“Even the most efficient solar cells can provide only a few miles of additional range per day, even if parked in the sunniest spot in the sunniest state,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The average electric vehicle can get about 3.5 miles of range with one kilowatt-hour of electricity. A car with solar cells can generate maybe three to four kWh per day, which is enough to drive 10 to 14 miles per day on just solar power.”</p>\n<p>He pointed out that past attempts at solar-powered EVs by Sono Sion and Lightyear One both had solar cells that peaked at around 1.2 kilowatts of power under full sun. “This means that the car would need to be perfectly clean and parked in the ideal location on a very sunny day for several hours to get the maximum 14 miles per day range,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t see a huge opportunity unless we see meaningful progress with the technology and the cost that would enable them to compete with existing vehicles today, including electric vehicles and those with internal combustion engines,” added Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist and chair of the electric vehicle committee at Chicago-based <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a>.</p>\n<p>He explained that Aptera is targeting 40 miles for an all-solar range, after which the vehicle becomes an electric car with a battery. “I just don’t see consumers really being willing to pay extra for 40 miles of solar-powered driving.”</p>\n<h3>Vagaries of Solar Power</h3>\n<p>Even if the surface-to-power problem is addressed, there are other vagaries of solar power. “Cars are subject to weather conditions, falling leaves, bird poop, and other debris that cause loss of power output from solar cells,” Zientara noted.</p>\n<p>He added that it is nearly impossible to perfectly orient the solar cells in a car’s surface to the sun. “To get the most from solar cells, they must be angled exactly perpendicular to incoming sunlight,” he explained. “A car has many, many different surfaces, all of which are angled in different directions. If you maximize the orientation of one surface, the others are not pointed directly at the sun.”</p>\n<p>Then there’s the sun moving in the sky problem. “Even if you can point one or more of a vehicle’s faces directly at the sun, they won’t stay that way for very long,” Zientara noted. “And the sun also changes throughout the year, shining down more directly on the northern hemisphere in the summer and much less directly in the winter. So solar cells in a car’s surface will generate more energy during the summer and less during the winter, regardless of weather.”</p>\n<p>Solar-powered vehicles may find a place in niche markets. “Solar-powered vehicles are potentially sufficient for use cases where extended travel in sunny regions can maximize energy generation, such as rural or remote areas with limited access to charging infrastructure,” Vena said. “They are well-suited for low-speed, short-distance transportation, like delivery services, campus shuttles, or recreational vehicles, where energy demand is lower.”</p>\n<p>“Solar-powered vehicles can also serve as backup power sources or sustainable alternatives for off-grid living, contributing to energy independence and reduced carbon footprints,” he added.</p>\n<p>“They won’t be viable for most people,” Enderle acknowledged, “but for those that can, or need to use them for living off the grid or because they have no viable charging alternatives, they could be a godsend.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Microsoft was the first to put AI on devices with its Copilot+ launch months ago. It caught Google and Apple sleeping and seemed poised to own the AI space with the help of OpenAI and ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>However, Microsoft’s execution was so flawed that it isn’t clear if anyone is even using these Copilot+ features now. <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recall</a> is still being held back, and buyers are confused about what is or is not an AI PC, given there are no desktop AI PCs, gaming AI PCs, or workstation AI PCs in the market or on the near-term horizon.</p>\n<p>This has given both Apple and Google time to close the competitive gap. Apple <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/apple-goes-all-in-on-a-privacy-based-ai-experience-179236.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> its Apple Intelligence initiative in June and then rolled it out last week in a way that should have more general Apple users using desktop and smartphone AI than Windows users are. Google has also begun to roll out AI features, so both companies are taking advantage of Microsoft’s extremely poor execution.</p>\n<p>The big difference for Apple is that it has started offering AI experiences in Apple stores with 15-minute sessions so that Apple users and potential users can play with the technology and become more familiar with it. There is no similar effort from either Microsoft or Google.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss how this is likely to benefit Apple and its users during this AI rollout. We’ll then close with my Product of the Week, my new favorite phone: the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which I now carry daily.</p>\n<h3>The Problem With People and Features</h3>\n<p>We are creatures of habit. We tend to like to do things as we’ve always done them. This is problematic for companies like Microsoft and feature-rich products like Office 365 and Windows because their advantage over other offerings is their more features.</p>\n<p>What makes this problematic is that if users don’t use the massive number of features, it is relatively easy to migrate those users to a competing offering because the competition doesn’t have to bridge all of the features, only the ones most people actually use. We are seeing this happen today with Google Workspace, which, while not as complete as Office 365, does what most people want done and is far cheaper during a time of belt-tightening.</p>\n<p>If you don’t get people to use and like the parts of your product that make it unique, even if dominant, a lower-cost competitor can easily migrate those users to their competing offering. To overcome this, if you have a complex product or a unique set of features like, say, Copilot+, you need to promote using these features and remind users of their value. Otherwise, your ability to retain your customer base is significantly degraded.</p>\n<h3>Internet Explorer Example</h3>\n<p>We saw this happen with Internet Explorer. Initially blindsided by Netscape Navigator, Microsoft executed exceptionally well and ultimately stole the market away.</p>\n<p>Netscape’s downfall stemmed from two strategic missteps. First, they openly challenged Microsoft. Then, instead of making Navigator a front end to a suite of compelling web tools, Netscape chose to compete directly with Microsoft Office. This shift placed them on Microsoft’s turf, a battlefield they were not equipped to win. Netscape lost that battle and became part of history.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Then, after rising to around 98% market share, Microsoft defunded IE much as it has now largely defunded Windows. Google came forward with a version of its Chrome browser that seemed to work better than IE, and Microsoft bled market share.</p>\n<p>Given that Microsoft Edge — the browser that followed Internet Explorer — is now based on Google’s Chromium technology, Google owns the browser space and isn’t repeating the mistakes that Netscape and Microsoft made.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence Screw Up</h3>\n<p>Generative AI, the current advanced iteration of AI, is moving aggressively into the market, mainly via the cloud. Microsoft launched Copilot+ with two features: Cocreator and Recall, which, on paper, were both very useful. Then Microsoft had to pull Recall back because its presentation raised security concerns without mitigating them, and Cocreator alone is basically Dall-E but running locally.</p>\n<p>In addition, the only PCs that would run these two apps were those initially configured with the Snapdragon X processor and were focused on people who valued high portability but not performance. It’s a group that just typically wants the basics and doesn’t chase new features or capabilities as much as performance users, gamers, and workstation users do.</p>\n<p>So, not only was one of the two apps held back, but the people targeted with the hardware were not those that typically would be first movers for AI tools.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been one of the worst misfires I’ve ever seen.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s Better AI Approach</h3>\n<p>Apple is rolling out its AI tools to its entire customer base, not just a subset of laptop users. Plus, if done right, the in-store experiences mentioned above will convince users to try and eventually use these AI tools, ramping up use far faster than Microsoft’s approach can.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>As a result, even though Apple’s AI implementation still lags behind Microsoft’s, more people are likely to use it, so it should be a far stronger competitive differentiator. This is because an unused feature has no value, and Apple is simply doing a far better job of getting people to use Apple Intelligence than Microsoft is doing with Copilot.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>While entering a market first, as Microsoft did, can provide a significant competitive advantage, poor execution allows competing companies to slipstream this initial effort and seize the market the first mover created. This is what happened with Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. Microsoft moved late in that race, but it out-executed Netscape. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>Now we see something similar happen with AI between Apple and Microsoft — and Google is right behind Apple. Microsoft opened the market but stumbled, giving Apple the chance to step in with a stronger effort. While Microsoft’s Cloud AI efforts remain largely uncontested, its desktop AI effort is now being eclipsed by both Apple and Google due to Microsoft’s very poor execution.</p>\n<p>While part of this is because Microsoft abandoned the smartphone market, the result is the same: Apple is out-executing Microsoft. That means that Microsoft’s goal of displacing Apple will not only not be achieved this cycle, but Apple has a decent chance of taking a significant share from Microsoft as people become more excited about Apple’s more useful AI tools and base user training.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h3>\n<p>I read a lot, and I’ve long been a Microsoft phone user, both initially and when Microsoft brought out the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2. The Duo phones were perfect for me because they used Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, worked incredibly well, and they felt like a book when reading on them.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, keeping with the trend since Bill Gates stepped down from the company, Microsoft again under-executed with the Duo and is again out of the phone business, leading me to search for a replacement.</p>\n<p>The closest was the Google Pixel Fold, which was a good phone but lacked a powerful processor, and it was decidedly less feature-rich than my old and obsolete Duo 2 phone, which had to be retired. Then the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_9_pro_fold?hl=en-US&amp;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> came out. While it, too, lacks a Qualcomm processor (which it should have as a premium phone), the Google processor it has is far more powerful than the one in the old Pixel Fold, and it supports head-mounted displays that the older Pixel Fold did not.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"First look at #Pixel9 Pro Fold #Google #Gemini #MadebyGoogle\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fpg9NukyWyI\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As a result, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been a dream to live with. It has decent all-day battery life even if I’m reading for most of the day, fast inductive charging (though the magnet on the phone is weaker than on earlier phones, so inductive charging placement is a bit more difficult), the camera is very good, and the sound quality, for a small device, is decent as well.</p>\n<p>At around $1,300, this isn’t a cheap phone, but it is worth the money. While I’m still lusting after that <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/arm-goes-to-war-against-qualcomm-stupid-squared-179438.html#product-of-the-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huawei Tri-Fold</a> phone I can’t get my hands on, this Google phone is certainly less expensive and more practical.</p>\n<p>The phone is handy for movies on a plane or in a car, great for reading and browsing the web, and has a head-mounted display and a keyboard. It can even sub for my laptop in a pinch. I’ve been very pleased with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and it is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>This week’s Microsoft Ignite 2024 event in Chicago served as a platform to showcase Microsoft’s vision and strategies aimed squarely at corporate and enterprise customers.</p>\n<p>The keynote highlighted transformative technological shifts and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving these changes. This year’s theme revolved around Microsoft’s commitment to empowering businesses through AI-powered innovations, streamlining workflows, and enhancing productivity.</p>\n<p>CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote opened by reflecting on past technological milestones, comparing the current rise of AI to pivotal moments like the launch of Windows 3.1 and the growth of cloud computing.</p>\n<p>The focus, however, remained on the here and now: AI’s potential to reshape enterprise operations. Microsoft is positioning itself as a leader in this domain through three core AI offerings — Copilot, Copilot Devices, and the Copilot AI Stack.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft’s AI Strategy: All About Copilot</h3>\n<p>The Copilot ecosystem is at the heart of Microsoft’s enterprise strategy. It serves as an AI-powered user interface that integrates deeply across the Microsoft 365 suite, automating tasks, offering personalized insights, and enhancing collaboration.</p>\n<p>Examples shared during the keynote illustrated real-world applications, such as Vodafone leveraging Copilot to streamline contract management and Bank of Queensland using AI to reduce risk analysis timelines. Organizations can automate repetitive tasks and increase efficiency by creating tailored AI agents using Copilot Studio.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft Emphasizes Security</h3>\n<p>Security was another focal point, with Microsoft emphasizing its “Secure Future Initiative” that prioritizes a zero-trust approach to security and continuous improvement in data governance.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Updates to Purview, Microsoft’s data governance platform, aim to address the challenges associated with AI, such as data protection and malicious intent detection. The keynote also featured a significant announcement: the Zero Day Quest hacking event — a competitive initiative designed to identify vulnerabilities in AI systems that underscores Microsoft’s commitment to securing AI and cloud technologies.</p>\n<h3>AI-Optimized Devices Take Center Stage</h3>\n<p>The event further showcased Microsoft’s innovations in AI-optimized devices. Introducing Copilot+ PCs marks a step toward integrating cloud and AI capabilities at the edge, creating a seamless distributed computing environment.</p>\n<p>These devices, developed in collaboration with OEMs like AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, offer enhanced AI performance and energy efficiency. This collaboration highlights both the opportunities and challenges Microsoft faces in its pursuit of a cohesive user experience.</p>\n<p>The Ignite keynote emphasized Microsoft’s goal of transforming enterprise productivity with AI-driven solutions across every layer of its stack, including infrastructure, applications, and user interfaces. Copilot integration extends beyond chat and document drafting to include advanced features such as AI-driven data analysis in Excel, automated meeting summaries in Teams, and dynamic presentation creation in PowerPoint.</p>\n<p>The comprehensive integration of AI across Microsoft 365 exemplifies the company’s ambition to drive change across all facets of work.</p>\n<h3>Demonstrating ROI With Copilot Analytics</h3>\n<p>Measurement and ROI were also highlighted as critical factors for AI adoption. Copilot Analytics provides tools for businesses to correlate Copilot usage with specific business metrics, such as increased sales or improved operational efficiency.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>By demonstrating tangible outcomes, Microsoft aims to underscore the value of its AI offerings and help organizations justify their investments in AI technology.</p>\n<h3>Navigating OEM Partnerships, Messaging Challenges</h3>\n<p>Despite these advancements, the keynote did not shy away from the challenges ahead. A key takeaway is Microsoft’s dependence on its complex ecosystem of OEM partners.</p>\n<p>Unlike Apple, which maintains a singular voice in communicating the benefits of new technologies, Microsoft must rely on various OEMs to deliver and market its innovations. This challenging reliance can lead to fragmented messaging, making it difficult for end-users to fully understand the value and capabilities of Microsoft’s AI solutions.</p>\n<p>While collaboration with OEMs allows for flexibility and diverse offerings, it also introduces inconsistencies that can hinder consumer adoption and awareness.</p>\n<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>\n<p>In the final analysis, Microsoft Ignite highlighted the company’s ambitious vision for AI-driven transformation within enterprise environments. Microsoft seeks to redefine productivity, streamline operations, and drive business growth through its Copilot platforms.</p>\n<p>However, to fully realize this vision, the company must navigate the complexities of its OEM partnerships, striving to present a cohesive and compelling narrative that resonates with both corporate customers and end-users.</p>\n<p>By addressing these challenges, Microsoft aims to solidify its position as a leader in AI-driven enterprise solutions while ensuring its message is as clear and impactful as possible.</p>\n<p>While little of Nadella’s keynote focused on the classic mainstream consumer — a space where Apple is likely to gain more traction due to its friendlier brand perception and excellence in singular messaging — Microsoft is understandably focusing on the enterprise and corporate markets, which CIOs and IT executives recognize as its strongest foothold for early AI adoption — after all, that’s where the AI money is.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I stopped working for Forrester in 2002 and went out on my own as an independent analyst. At that time, Intel’s valuation and power significantly eclipsed AMD and Nvidia. Intel had a strong corporate brand, and Pentium was so popular people <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMvS1Q1sos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote songs about it</a>, and Qualcomm wasn’t even on Intel’s radar.</p>\n<p>Twenty-two years later, Intel is hurt and bleeding. AMD is hosting an event at the Moscone Center, where Intel used to hold its huge IDF events. Nvidia is the highest-valued company in the group, and Qualcomm reportedly recently explored a move to buy Intel.</p>\n<p>What the hell happened? Intel took its eye off the ball and repeated many of the same mistakes that IBM made in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine how Intel’s trajectory has changed over the past two decades, tracing the key missteps and missed opportunities that allowed AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm to surpass it. We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new Lenovo laptop that uses Intel’s new Lunar Lake Core Ultra 7 processors.</p>\n<h3>IBM to Intel</h3>\n<p>When I worked at IBM, I wrote a report largely because I was extremely frustrated by how the company, which had been massively dominant when I joined it, had lost that dominance.</p>\n<p>At IBM, I worked in finance, internal audit, and marketing. I was one of the people who tried to point out that IBM was about to lose its dominance, only to be told by the VP to whom I reported that “IBM sells the equivalent of air. Customers have no choice but to buy from us.” Clearly, this turned out to be untrue, as customers eventually fled the company in huge numbers, almost putting IBM out of business.</p>\n<p>In a panic, IBM’s Board of Directors fired then-CEO John Akers and replaced him with Louis Gerstner, a marketing expert who knew nothing about tech but rightly realized that IBM first had to fix its image and restore sales volume, or the company would fail.</p>\n<p>This was similar to what happened at Apple in the late 90s with Steve Jobs. Apple’s products weren’t competitive, but the base was still loyal, so Jobs initially moved to fix Apple’s image of having crap products and then eventually fixed those products. Still, he never would have been able to do the latter had he not first fixed Apple’s image and slowed its sales decline.</p>\n<p>IBM’s recovery under Gerstner was nearly magical, with CFO Jeremy York, who also played a role in Apple’s turnaround, doing much of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Gerstner built a marketing organization that arguably surpassed even Nabisco’s, his previous company.</p>\n<p>However, the recovery slowed when York left IBM, and it virtually stopped when Sam Palmisano decided marketing wasn’t that important, which collapsed Gerstner’s marketing effort. Had Palmisano not done that, I believe IBM would be much larger and more powerful today.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s, Intel was a marketing powerhouse under the marketing leadership of Dennis Carter and the brilliant leadership of Andy Grove. Intel reached a level of dominance in its segment that, while not as great as IBM’s had been, was still far ahead of its competitors.</p>\n<p>However, once Dennis Carter and Andy Grove retired, Intel started to take its massive leadership for granted. Marketing execution and funding declined dramatically, and Intel began burning through subsequent CEOs, each with a different vision. The most damage was done by Brian Krzanich, who effectively put the company’s primary product on life support as he tried to chase Qualcomm’s smartphone market.</p>\n<p>Intel started to fall behind AMD, which remained focused and had more consistent leadership, particularly over the last decade under IBM-trained Lisa Su. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, buoyed by its smartphone success, aimed to enter the PC market, and Nvidia quietly bet on AI, which seemed more like a 2040 event than near-term technology. The loss of Justin Rattner, Intel’s near-legendary CTO, was also problematic and likely helped keep Intel’s leadership in the dark about AI’s potential.</p>\n<p>Pushed by Apple, Intel failed dramatically in its effort to take out Qualcomm, which made it look vulnerable and made the world aware that Intel’s execution wasn’t where it should have been, and marketing was a shadow of what it once was. It was no longer strategic, so much as a cost center that seemed to lack any institutional value.</p>\n<p>Thus, Intel had no defense against the erosion of its brand or the appearance of market leadership.</p>\n<h3>AI Hits</h3>\n<p>The rise of AI last year was 20 years in the making. Only Nvidia and IBM invested significantly in this technology, although even IBM didn’t think it would hit as soon as it did, with every subsequent CEO underfunding the effort against its potential.</p>\n<p>Nvidia equipped OpenAI with its technology, and ChatGPT was adopted by Microsoft in a move similar to what it did with Spyglass — Microsoft’s initial successful effort to take out Netscape Navigator — and adopted ChatGPT under the brand Copilot.</p>\n<p>Nvidia rode the wave because it helped create it, and AMD, already used to fast-following Intel, came up quickly from behind. Companies like Microsoft and Google now treat AMD’s AI solutions as peers to Nvidia’s offerings. Given that Nvidia’s offerings are so popular that it cannot keep up with demand, AMD is seeing a substantial uplift in its visibility and revenue.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Qualcomm, working with Microsoft, created an AI platform for PCs that was performant and provided huge battery life benefits. Again, AMD quickly pivoted and brought to market a Qualcomm-competitive effort that performs well against Qualcomm’s offering — partially because it doesn’t need an emulator for x86.</p>\n<p>Intel not only didn’t see AI coming (to be fair, no one did), but when Microsoft asked for an NPU, Intel pushed back instead of stepping up. It did an incredible job of bringing in its Lunar Lake technology that had been two years out, but it is a premium part, and Intel won’t have a performant NPU in the mainstream for at least another year.</p>\n<p>Now, the desktop implementations of AI are still very limited and not widely used. No workstations, desktop PCs, or gaming PCs (laptops or desktops) have NPUs yet. This situation should give Intel the time it needs, but the lack of Intel marketing doesn’t allow it to pitch what it has properly, so it’s bleeding market share.</p>\n<p>Even though Intel still leads in market share, it appears to be where AMD used to be seemingly overnight, and it’s chasing AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm rather than appearing as the market share leader it is.</p>\n<p>If Intel still had a marketing team funded and supported as it was under Dennis Carter, it could do what IBM did under Louis Gerstner and Apple did under Steve Jobs by slowing its market erosion until it came up with a performant solution. As good as Lunar Lake is, it isn’t broad enough to carry this load alone, and without powerful marketing, it will likely underperform its potential anyway.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: The Problem With Under-Resourcing Marketing</h3>\n<p>That conversation I had at IBM has haunted me for decades because it is so frequently repeated. Tech firms tend not to listen to customers. I get it. As Steve Jobs once said, customers often don’t know what they want. But that means companies need to do what Jobs did and position what they offer against needs customers don’t yet realize they have. This ability to manipulate demand is the purview of marketing.</p>\n<p>Taking the iPhone as an example, it was based on the LG Prada phone that failed largely because people just didn’t like virtual keyboards. They preferred physical keyboards that existed from Microsoft, Palm, and Research In Motion (Blackberry).</p>\n<p>With little resistance, Apple convinced the market that its virtual keyboard design was superior by emphasizing entertainment features. Rather than defending their positions, the leading competitors followed Apple’s lead, effectively ending the era of keyboard smartphones. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>The recurring mistake is under-resourcing marketing and taking customers for granted. It’s interesting to note that only IBM recognized this because of Louis Gerstner and effectively addressed the issue with IBM’s recovery, but even they forgot this lesson with the subsequent CEO.</p>\n<p>Thus, we are seeing a trend similar to that seen with IBM vs. Sun, Netscape vs. Microsoft, Palm/Nokia/Microsoft/Blackberry vs. Apple, and now Intel vs. AMD/Nvidia/Qualcomm, as leadership again shifts because the once dominant vendor didn’t adequately defend its image of dominance and success with marketing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition Laptop</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-slim-series/yoga-slim-7i-gen-9-aura-edition-15-inch-intel/len101y0051\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition</a> is an impressive laptop that uses the new Lunar Lake Intel Core Ultra 7 processor.</p>\n<p>It is a premium notebook with a reasonable entry price of under $1,300.

There are some additional features I haven’t had a chance to try yet. One is that it can take the refresh rate from 30 to 120 Hz based on need, which not only provides gaming-like frame rates when you need them but energy savings when you don’t.</p>\n<p>Back to the keyboard. I’m writing on this laptop now, and it is surprisingly quiet and comfortable. It has the feel of a mechanical keyboard but not the annoying clicking sound they often have. This isn’t a gaming laptop — it has Intel Arc graphics — but I love this keyboard and will be sad to see this laptop go back to Lenovo in a week or so.</p>\n<p>The display is a very nice 15-inch 2.8K, one of the finest non-OLED displays I’ve seen so far. OLED is better, but it pulls a ton of power, making this display a decent tradeoff.</p>\n<p>The port-outs are decent, with Thunderbolt and USB-C ports and a legacy USB-A port. On the side next to the power switch, there is a “camera off” switch (the camera supports Windows Hello and is nice but not anything special).</p>\n<p>The sound from the laptop is impressive, and it supports Dolby Atmos. I think this is the best-sounding laptop that I have tested this year. Oh, and it has a headphone jack, which means if you forget your expensive wireless headphones on a trip, you can buy cheap, wired earbuds and still watch your movies.

      "content": "<p>One of the most influential teachers I’ve had was my university music professor. One piece of wisdom particularly resonates with me: he asked, “How good would you be if you did everything your teacher told you to do?” His point was not that you should unquestioningly do what you’re told. Rather, he meant that after we’re familiar enough with a discipline, we know what yields improvement at it. We know what habits, procedures, and mindsets will make us better at what we do.</p>\n<p>Of course, he wouldn’t have made this remark if we <em>did</em> consistently do what we knew we should. But why? There are many possible reasons, but I believe the most common is simply laziness.</p>\n<p>Addressing all those fundamentals is hard work and not as fun as doing the flashy stuff. If you were building a skyscraper, would you prefer to cement the foundation or construct the penthouse level? We don’t appreciate that sturdy base unless we discover, often catastrophically, that it’s faulty.</p>\n<h4>Inspection Time</h4>\n<p>In that spirit, I wanted to be a responsible engineer and examine our foundation. The following observations were compiled with software engineering in mind, as I identified them while working in that discipline. However, these practices apply universally. For each one, I have an example of when it proved the decisive factor for success.</p>\n<p><strong>Check every assumption.</strong> It is alarmingly easy to assume a “truth” on faith when, in reality, it is open to debate. Effective problem-solving starts by examining assumptions because the assumptions that survive your scrutiny will dictate which approaches remain viable. If you didn’t know your intended plan rested on an unfounded or invalid assumption, imagine how disastrously it would be to proceed anyway. Why take that gamble?</p>\n<p><em>Recently, I worked on a project that involved aligning software deployment to an industry best practice. However, to meet specialized requirements, the project’s leadership relied on unique definitions of common terms, deviating ever so slightly from the standard industry definitions. If I had assumed the typical industry definitions, I would have missed some requirements.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Look up every term you don’t understand.</strong> When encountering an unfamiliar term, it’s easy to expect that we can intuit it from context or that it’s marginal enough in context that we can get the gist without it. Even if that’s true, how do you know until you check? How do you know you wouldn’t understand the topic on a much deeper level if you took five minutes to look it up?</p>\n<p><em>When I initially embarked on my crash course in computer science, I didn’t read very deeply into object-oriented programming. “Yeah, yeah,” I thought, “everything is an object.” But once I took the time to explore the details, I learned what traits define object-oriented programming and how those traits, in turn, dictate how it can be applied. From there, I had enough background to start considering what problems an object-oriented approach is good and bad at solving.</em></p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p><strong>Check the credibility of all your sources.</strong> I’m not telling you to only read the documentation (although it’s wise to start there), but you shouldn’t ascribe credibility to a source until you’ve checked it against information you already know is credible — like the documentation. I’ve written more than one piece about the difference between the commonly accepted way and the correct way. My recent article on <a href=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/story/crafting-advanced-dns-configurations-on-linux-177298.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linux DNS configuration</a> is a good example.</p>\n<p><em>I constantly encounter wide gulfs between what the documentation advises and what developers on forums confidently assert. For instance, I had to generate <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RFC 4122-compliant</a> UUIDs. In the particular language I was using, many developers recommended using a 3rd-party library. However, after careful research, I determined that the language’s built-in cryptographic library could already generate UUIDs. By omitting the third-party package, I reduced the number of dependencies as well as the attack surface for the application I was creating.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Take notes, then take some more notes.</strong> In the last year or so, I have made a point to capture the stray ideas, whether internalized or synthesized, instead of letting them dissipate. Since then, I’ve observed that I’m more productive and absorb more information even if I don’t reread my notes. The value of copious notes is intuitive: it takes much less time to write down too much and scan through everything than to write down too little and return to your sources to relocate what you omitted. With digital notes, it makes even more sense to record everything you read. A Ctrl-F search of even the most massive note file is far faster than retracing your investigation.</p>\n<p><em>While researching how to configure and test some applications, I took notes on the criteria I used to select configurations. I noted everything on a private documentation page, even creating a flowchart to illustrate all my considerations. At the time, the page was only for checking and reinforcing my understanding. But once I realized that other developers would benefit from following in my footsteps, I already had a page ready.</em></p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>Test everything you design or build. It is astounding how often testing gets skipped. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/18/security_review_failure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> showed that just under half of the time, information security professionals don’t audit major updates to their applications. It’s tempting to look at your application on paper and reason that it should be fine. But if everything worked like it did on paper, testing would never find any issues — yet so often it does. The whole point of testing is to discover what you didn’t anticipate. Because no one can foresee everything, the only way to catch what you didn’t is to test.</p>\n<p><em>One time, I was writing a program to check a response payload that arbitrarily contained nested data structures of various types. While there is one overwhelmingly common data structure for the top level of such payloads, i.e., the payload root, I wrote the program to handle a variety of top-level data structures. However, I only added this flexibility after testing a wide range of payloads during development. Had I not tested with uncommon or unexpected inputs, the program could have encountered edge cases that induced a failure.</em></p>\n<h4>Basics Aren’t Everything, Just Everything That Everything Depends On</h4>\n<p>Why do I fixate on basics like this? I can think of two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, I’ve seen the results for myself. Putting each of the above into consistent practice has improved the quality of my work, allowing me to tackle more complex problems. The work I’m doing now would be impossible without solidity on these basics.</p>\n<p>Second, companies continue to squeeze out more productivity from their workforce by adopting the cutting-edge technology of the day, generative AI being merely the latest iteration of this trend. Don’t mistake the means for the ends: Companies don’t intrinsically want generative AI or any particular tool; they want increased productivity.</p>\n<p>It’s too soon to say if generative AI will yield the quantum leap that so many seem to think it will. Before embracing a new paradigm, why not fully leverage an existing one? It’s way more efficient to improve on basics than add a new and specialized factor that may not remain relevant to the equation.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your discipline, more of what you do on a regular basis draws on basic skills than highly advanced ones. This is the Pareto Principle (more commonly known as the “80/20 Rule”) in action: 20% of your skills toolkit accomplishes 80% of your work.</p>\n<p>My current teacher likes to say that “mastery is just really refined basics.” Don’t overlook the road to mastery because of how unassuming it appears.</p>\n",

Even though the timing of this show sucks because it comes so soon after the holidays and steals vacations from those that have to prepare for it, I have to admit I look forward to this event every year. This year was heavy in AI, exercise and health equipment, PCs, and robotics.</p>\n<p>I won’t do a Product of the Week this week because each of the products I’m going to list could easily qualify, and given how different they are from each other, picking a winner would be hard to defend.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the product I have the greatest lust for.</p>\n<h3>Bodyfriend 733 Massage Chair</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Bodyfriend-733-Massage-Chair.jpg\" alt=\"Bodyfriend 733 Massage Chair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Bodyfriend-733-Massage-Chair.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Bodyfriend-733-Massage-Chair-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Bodyfriend-733-Massage-Chair-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Bodyfriend</p>\n<p>I have a massage chair at home and even have massage seats in my car, so I love the concept, but neither of these solutions is close to a real massage. However, if you have a spare $20,000, consider the <a href=\"https://bodyfriend.com/products/733-massage-chair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bodyfriend 733 Massage Chair</a>.</p>\n<p>It looks like the offspring of a Transformer and a yellow recliner. What makes this chair so expensive is that it will do physical therapy, which is huge when you get to be as ancient as I am. It forces stretching and mobility, and when used right, it could extend your mobility well into your later years, not to mention that it is less painful than sessions with human physical therapists.</p>\n<p>In effect, it blends massage functions with arm and leg exercises using heat and unique magnetic hand-like pressure to provide an experience that should be unmatched in this category. It is AI-driven, with 50 automatic programs to fully customize your experience. These features make it worth the massive $20,000 price point.</p>\n<p>The Bodyfriend 733 Massage Chair is definitely on my wish list of things I’m lusting for.</p>\n<h3>Lenovo Legion Go S 8-inch Gaming Handheld</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Lenovo-Legion-Go-S.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo Legion Go S (8”, 1) \" width=\"1000\" height=\"481\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Lenovo-Legion-Go-S.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Lenovo-Legion-Go-S-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Lenovo-Legion-Go-S-768x369.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Lenovo</p>\n<p>Lenovo has been pushing the innovation button hard of late and has two new products that caught my eye. The first is the Legion Go S 8-inch gaming handheld — a handheld gaming PC. Using AMD’s Ryzen Z2 Go processor and integrated RDNA graphics.</p>\n<p>This product, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-120hz-wuxga-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-go-32-gb-with-1-tb-ssd-glacier-white/6612958.p?skuId=6612958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">currently available for $749</a> on pre-order at Best Buy, is one awesome little PC. It has dual USB C 4.0 ports (so you could turn it into a mini-PC), runs Windows 11, and has eGPU compatibility, so it will play high-end PC games. There’s no camera, but it does have built-in microphones and speakers, though I’d suggest using headphones if you use this on a plane as they are likely to escort you off early if you don’t.</p>\n<p>This device will also switch between PC, Xbox, and Steam games with one click. This device class has been underpowered in the past, but this new AMD unit appears to have power to spare. It is a testament to how far AMD has come over the last decade or so. A more affordable $599 version with less memory will be released in May, though I think $130 for the extra memory is more than worth the additional cost.</p>\n<h3>Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ThinkBook-Plus-Gen-6.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo ThinkBook-Plus Gen 6 with Rollable Display\" width=\"1000\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ThinkBook-Plus-Gen-6.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ThinkBook-Plus-Gen-6-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ThinkBook-Plus-Gen-6-768x445.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Lenovo</p>\n<p>Foldable displays have become common on smartphones but haven’t taken off on PCs yet. Lenovo has brought forward an even more interesting technology, rollable displays, and used it on an impressive little 14-inch laptop that will expand up to 16.7 inches, which is a more acceptable size for a monitor that grants substantially more real estate on an under-four-pound laptop (1.7 kg).</p>\n<p>I use a 49-inch Dell monitor on my desk, so switching to a 14-inch or smaller laptop screen is really annoying. Expanding that screen to nearly 17 inches would make a huge difference in my productivity, so I look forward to seeing this. It uses Intel’s Core Ultra processors for strong performance and has Microsoft Copilot+ compatibility.</p>\n<p>Granted, at around $3,500, this isn’t a cheap date, but if you need the space like I do, this could be well worth the extra cost — and the wow factor is off the charts. The only downside is that I don’t think you’ll be able to use the screen expansion in a coach seat (it expands up). Otherwise, this is the PC I want in my computer bag in 2025.</p>\n<h3>Nvidia Project Digits: Grace Blackwell Personal AI Supercomputer</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Nvidia-Project-Digits-Supecomputer.jpg\" alt=\"NVIDIA Project DIGITS - A Grace Blackwell AI Supercomputer on your desk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Nvidia-Project-Digits-Supecomputer.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Nvidia-Project-Digits-Supecomputer-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Nvidia-Project-Digits-Supecomputer-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Nvidia</p>\n<p>I must admit I’ve been expecting Nvidia to do this for some time now, and I wasn’t disappointed at CES. The Nvidia keynote set the tone for the show with massive AI, robotics, and autonomous car elements.</p>\n<p>Still, what really knocked my socks off was the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/project-digits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nvidia Project Digits</a> personal computer. This tiny machine has massive power, making it one of the world’s smallest and most powerful personal supercomputers. It has an Arm CPU and a special Blackwell GPU for incredible power (a full petaflop of FP4 performance), 128GB of unified, coherent memory, and up to 4TB of NVMe (non-volatile memory express) storage.</p>\n<p>It runs Nvidia’s Linux (I’m guessing Microsoft missed a meeting) called DBX OS, and it provides server-level AI performance in a tiny desktop form factor. This machine is used for prototyping, fine-tuning, and testing AI models, making it critical for those learning how to or who are already developing AI models or running Nvidia’s Omniverse simulations.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this won’t run PC games, but if you plan to make money on AI rather than spend it, this machine should probably be on your shortlist for 2025. The PC starts at around $3,000 and is about the size of one of the paperbacks of “The Lord of the Rings” books. I think they should have named it AWESOME (AI Workstation Engineering System Operative Manufacturing Engine), but it is code-named Digits.</p>\n<h3>Tombot Jennie Robotic Puppy</h3>\n<p>One of the problems with getting older is that you get lonely and lose the ability to care for pets properly. You need companionship, but even if you can care for a pet, there is a real risk that the pet will be traumatized and left homeless if you die.</p>\n<p>Tombot has created a <a href=\"https://tombot.com/pages/meet-our-puppies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">robotic dog</a> named Jennie that looks and feels like a puppy. It has interactive sensors, responds to voice commands, and makes real puppy sounds, but it doesn’t pee on your floor. Basically, it just sits on your lap and keeps you company.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"REG CF 2024 Campaign Video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rSklbu6RnuA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This product is for people who are hospitalized or mobility challenged and want the experience of a pet but lack the ability to care for one. This robotic Labrador puppy is expected to cost under $500, which is pretty cheap compared to a real dog.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8082946/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Studies have shown</a> that a pet can significantly improve the quality of life for someone alone, lonely or unable to get out. Tombot Jennie could make a huge difference for someone who has lost their smile due to age or infirmity, so giving them their smile back would be invaluable.</p>\n<h3>Roborock Saros Z70 Robot Vacuum</h3>\n<p>I have three robotic vacuum cleaners that are forever running into socks, pet toys, and anything left on the floor. Wouldn’t it be great if a robotic vacuum could pick stuff up while it vacuumed? Well, the folks at Roborock must agree with me because they created the <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/pages/ces-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roborock Saros Z70</a>, a $1,000 robotic vacuum/mop with an arm that can pick up stuff off the floor.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Saros Z70 - Grasp the Future with Intelligence\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/87Q6hE4cKPM\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This robotic vacuum has a docking station where it can dump what it vacuums up, and it will automatically attach or remove the mops depending on need, which is unique to this class of robotic vacuums.</p>\n<p>The demos I saw of the device suggest the software still needs some work, so I wouldn’t buy one of the first of these, but once they get the software sorted out, this would be a killer solution for those of us with pets and kids. I’m just hoping it knows enough to identify dog poop before it drags it all over the house (a rather bad experience we had with an older robotic vacuum).</p>\n<p>Oh, and the vacuum has an interesting Call &amp; Cruise video function that will allow it to roam around your house so you can check on the status of your home remotely and yell at your kids or pets if they are getting into trouble. It is due out around June of this year.</p>\n<h3>OpenDroids R2D3 Ultimate Home Robot</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179531\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179531\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/R2D3-home-robot.jpg\" alt=\"OpenDroids R2D3 home robot\" width=\"200\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/R2D3-home-robot.jpg 200w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/R2D3-home-robot-141x300.jpg 141w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179531\"><span>Image Credit: OpenDroids</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>At $55,000, this is far from a cheap date and well over my budget, but darn if I’m not intrigued.</p>\n<p>This rolling robot is designed to help you around the home, though stairs will be an issue. Fully AI-enabled and with dual lifting arms, the <a href=\"https://opendroids.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenDroids R2D3</a> is a pretty amazing showcase of just where we are with shipping personal robotics.</p>\n<p>OpenDroids also has a lower-cost <a href=\"https://www.opendroids.com/r1d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">R1D1</a> single-armed robot for around $18,500, which is showcased using a handheld vacuum cleaner that could do many of the same things.</p>\n<p>But it’s the R2D3 that comes closest to Rosie, the Jetsons’ robot maid we all wanted as kids when I was young. This robot would be particularly useful for someone who is disabled and needs help around the home, though given it is on wheels and not legs, getting up or down stairs would be problematic.</p>\n<p>The robot’s body raises and lowers based on need, suggesting it could reach things that would be out of reach unless we had a ladder handy. OpenDroids’ R2D3 was arguably the most impressive robot at CES this year.</p>\n<h3>Amp Strength Trainer</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Amp-home-fitness-device.jpg\" alt=\"Amp home fitness gym system\" width=\"1000\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Amp-home-fitness-device.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Amp-home-fitness-device-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Amp-home-fitness-device-768x453.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Amp Fit</p>\n<p>It is January, and like a lot of you, I’m considering joining a gym again (I quit during the pandemic), but driving to the local gym early in the morning tends to get old, and often the equipment I want to use was being used by someone else. My final excuse is that viruses seem to be spreading again, making it likely I will want to avoid places where people congregate and spread bodily fluids (sweat).</p>\n<p>But home exercise equipment takes up a lot of space, and I’ve had to get rid of a lot of it over the years. The <a href=\"https://ampfit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amp home fitness machine</a> is AI-driven, has Peloton-like features that work through your phone or tablet, and is both small and simple, making it look good in the home and very easy to use.</p>\n<p>The equipment costs $1,795, and the subscription to the trainers is a reasonable $23 per month. The price includes delivery and setup. Strength training is increasingly important to maintain mobility, flexibility, and freedom as we age, making it critical that I find a solution like Amp to ensure my future physical well-being. It’s due out in early 2025.</p>\n<h3>Realbotix Full-Bodied Robot</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.realbotix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Realbotix</a> full-bodied robot is close enough to the “Star Trek: The Next Generation” Data character to be scary. At $175,000 to $200,000 for the fully featured version (you can buy the AI bust for $10,000, but I expect it will nag you to buy the rest of her body), this is no cheap date, but it will pack into a suitcase.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Realbotix: Advancing Realistic Humanoid Robots &amp; Companionship-Based AI\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3MpHO8xcIk\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>When unpacked, it will walk and act like a human, though I think it is on the wrong side of the uncanny valley. It comes close enough to what we believe an android will eventually become, but it is a bit freaky, and it makes me want to ensure my future robotic overlords won’t be a problem.</p>\n<p>While Realbotix hasn’t achieved its entire mission of making a robot indistinguishable from a human, Melody comes closer than I thought possible, given where we are with today’s technology. It’s the best showcase for how far we have come to creating our own <a href=\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data android</a>.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>CES 2025 was an impressive show this year, and I didn’t even cover flying and autonomous cars, although most of them aren’t due out until far later in the decade. From robots that will help you recover from an injury, help you work out, keep you company, or clean your house, CES had it all, including some fantastic PCs for gaming, productivity, and creating your own future AI. CES was the place to see the future that is coming at us amazingly rapidly.</p>\n<p>I can hardly wait until next year. I’m kind of hoping Skynet won’t be part of next year’s show, though if you know where John Connor is, you might want to tell him it is past time for him to begin preparing for the future.</p>\n<p>Happy New Year everyone. Here’s hoping our AI and robotic future will be amazing!</p>\n\n",

      "content": "<p>Many amazing products launched this year, and we’ll cover some of them. However, unlike most years when the decision was difficult, one product stood out well above the rest as revolutionary. What made it particularly special was that it was a bold bet that paid off and helped its manufacturer become one of, and for a time, <em>the</em> most valuable company in the world.</p>\n<p>Typically, I don’t do a Product of the Week for this column as it focuses on the Product of the Year, but I ran into a confection that I’ve become almost addicted to, thanks to my love of dark chocolate, so I’m compelled to squeeze it in. It’s from a small company called Sweet as Fudge. So, before we revisit 2024 and discuss some of the standout products, let’s talk about this chocolate.</p>\n<p>The product is <a href=\"https://sweetasfudge.com/products/dark-chocolate-triple-dipped-malt-balls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dark Chocolate Triple-Dipped Malt Balls</a>. There’s also a sugar-free version that’s surprisingly good. A pound costs around $15, but these things are so good. I keep them in the refrigerator so they melt more slowly in my mouth. If you are into chocolate and like malt (chocolate malt is my go-to drink in the summer), give them a try this holiday season.</p>\n<p>Now, on to the main event. Let’s begin with the contenders that didn’t quite make the top of my list and conclude with the one that earned the title of Product of the Year.</p>\n<h3>Fisker Ocean</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Fisker-Ocean.jpg\" alt=\"The All-Electric Fisker Ocean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Fisker-Ocean.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Fisker-Ocean-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Fisker-Ocean-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Fisker</p>\n<p>It’s a shame this company didn’t survive the year, but the Fisker Ocean — which I had planned to buy — was arguably the best electric SUV on paper. It had a bunch of cool, unique features like a solar panel roof and a pull-up table so the driver could enjoy a snack or meal in the car without making a mess.</p>\n<p>This eSUV was well-designed and had decent range, and I thought it was one of the best-looking vehicles in the market. Operating inefficiencies and apparently some financial mismanagement killed the company and the car. RIP Fisker.</p>\n<h3>2025 Audi RS e-tron® GT Performance</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2025-model-audi-rs-e-tron.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Audi RS e-tron® GT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2025-model-audi-rs-e-tron.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2025-model-audi-rs-e-tron-300x108.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2025-model-audi-rs-e-tron-768x276.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Audi Communications</p>\n<p>I bought a used 2022 Audi e-tron GT after Fisker went under. Right after I bought it, Audi released the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0wIKFGXyw0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2025 model</a>, and it is a beast. It has nearly 1,000 HP, giving it blazing performance (more than I need as my base car is quick enough), hydraulic suspension allowing it to adjust its height nearly instantly, and the car is beautiful.</p>\n<p>Oh, they added around 100 miles of range over my car, making it far more useful for a daily driver. At $171,000, it is out of my budget range, but wow, what a car!</p>\n<h3>Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N electric sports vehicle in action\" width=\"1000\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N-768x353.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Hyundai</p>\n<p>I think Hyundai’s approach with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVwfEOh0KBI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ioniq 5 N</a> electric car is the way to go for those who miss the engine sound and gear shifting in a manual gas car. This Hyundai is arguably the most fun electric car in the world. It does a decent job faking engine sounds, and shifting feels like you are shifting a car — even though this is emulated and actually makes the car slower. But it is incredibly fun to drive and reasonably quick (0 to 60 in 3.25 seconds).</p>\n<p>The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N&nbsp;isn’t badly priced for a performance car that lists under $70,000, and it’s likely quicker than your buddy’s far more expensive exotic car.</p>\n<h3>OpenAI’s ChatGPT</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/ChatGPT-smartphone.jpg\" alt=\"ChatGPT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/ChatGPT-smartphone.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/ChatGPT-smartphone-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/ChatGPT-smartphone-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Wow, talk about an offering that changed the world! <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT</a> is the core technology under both Apple and Microsoft’s AI efforts. Its Dall-E capability for images is impressive (as is Google’s Gemini, which I also use), and it has changed the way many of us write software, create images, and even write complete works.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT has been advancing incredibly quickly, and with artificial general intelligence (AGI) it promises to change how we create what we read. ChatGPT and its peers are starting to change what we watch. It is a truly revolutionary platform, though Google’s Gemini Advanced is no slouch either. While ChatGPT launched before 2024, it became the basis for both Microsoft’s and Apple’s huge AI efforts this year.</p>\n<h3>Windows 365 Link</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introducing Windows 365 Link: Satya Nadella at Microsoft Ignite 2024\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQpNTDgzIn8\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Ever since the PC came out, we’ve essentially been asking to go back to terminals. We love the freedom the PC gives us, but we aren’t crazy about the complexity of supporting them ourselves, particularly at scale. Microsoft helped create the problem, and, to be fair, it has mitigated a lot of the related pain by improving Windows.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365/link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows 365 Link</a> is a nearly instant, on-terminal-like device that promises and mostly delivers Windows capabilities with the reliability and simplicity of a terminal. It’s kind of a “Back to the Future” product and a bit of a man-bites-dog story. I expect this to be the future of the PC eventually.</p>\n<h3>Bluesky</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179460\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179460\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/X-fighting-Bluesky.jpg\" alt=\"A visual comparison between X (formerly Twitter) and Bluesky\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/X-fighting-Bluesky.jpg 400w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/X-fighting-Bluesky-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179460\"><span>Image by Author / Gemini</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ever since Elon Musk bought Twitter, many of us have been looking for an alternative. Each time we got excited about a new effort, we were disappointed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a> has been the closest thing to a better Twitter so far, and more and more people I know have migrated to it. Given its distributed architecture, it also has some technical advantages over X/Twitter.</p>\n<p>Its moderation, in my opinion, appears to be better than Twitter’s. It was a huge step in the right direction, and I hope it makes it into our future.</p>\n<h3>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"First look at #Pixel9 Pro Fold #Google #Gemini #MadebyGoogle\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fpg9NukyWyI\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9_pro_fold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is now the phone I carry, and it is awesome. The updates to the phone have been helpful. It locks if it moves suddenly, as if someone stole it, for instance. It also locks if you are reading in a plane when it takes off, but you can just log in again. It folds out into a small tablet, so if I don’t have my glasses handy, I can still make the text large enough to read. Speaking of reading, it is the best e-book alternative since the discontinued Microsoft Duo.</p>\n<p>I wish Google had used a Qualcomm Snapdragon instead of its own processor, but the difference isn’t as bad as it was with the first Fold. I’m just loving this phone.</p>\n<h3>Huawei Mate XT Tri-Fold Smartphone</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HUAWEI Mate XT ULTIMATE DESIGN - Crafted with Excellence\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe5dJCRWifo\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Huawei has demonstrated remarkable ingenuity by navigating technological restrictions to deliver one of the most desirable smartphones in the world, despite some initial growing pains because this was almost an entirely new platform.</p>\n<p>Given that Huawei wasn’t allowed to buy the technology from the U.S., this three-screen phone that went from iPhone to iPad size is a technical marvel. It showcases where we will likely go with phones and set itself apart from competitive devices this year.</p>\n<p>Huawei remains impressive, considering the problems posed by the conflicts between the U.S. and China this year. Impressive work.</p>\n<h3>Lenovo Auto Twist AI PC Concept</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lenovo Auto-Twist AI PC Concept: Redefining Focus, Uniquely Centered Around You.\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LJWMF-YXlY\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Lenovo is another company that stood out this year in terms of sheer innovation. The product that most caught my eye was the ThinkBook Auto-Twist AI PC Concept.</p>\n<p>What makes this PC different is that it automatically pans the screen and on-board camera based on where you are in the room. This feature is particularly handy for those of us who have to move around during team calls or when you need to watch a how-to video while doing something else.</p>\n<p>Watching that screen swivel automatically so it remained focused on the user was awesome. As AI advances, I expect we’ll see even more innovation when it comes to AI PCs.</p>\n<h3>HP Print AI</h3>\n<p>For me, 2024 was defined by AI innovations. The HP Print AI offering, released in September, directly addresses a lot of our aggravation with printers, automatically formatting things for pages without cutting off the borders and positioning the data and graphics so that each print job is perfect.</p>\n<p>We’ve all had issues when printing a document and not having it lay up properly. <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/sourcetable-ai-spreadsheet-aims-to-democratize-data-analytics-179677.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spreadsheets</a> are the worst, often printing one line or column on a page and then kicking out hundreds of useless print copies that make little or no sense, like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-before.jpg\" alt=\"Excel document print formatting error\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-before.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-before-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-before-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: HP</p>\n<p>HP Print AI will auto-format print jobs, so the printed document is useful. The AI analyzes your print job based on past training to determine the optimal format. Then, it auto-configures for that result so each print job is as perfect as the AI can make it, like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result.jpg\" alt=\"Excel HP print with AI result with corrected formatting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Excel-HP-Print-AI-result-768x433.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: HP</p>\n<p>Printer technology needs to be moved into this decade, and this software from HP should do that. Expect to see more advances like this from many companies that plan to use AI to address customer frustrations with their products.</p>\n<h3>Disney BDX Robots</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A New Approach to Disney’s Robotic Character Pipeline\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cfIm06tcfA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The BDX robots are part of <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/foundation-model-isaac-robotics-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Groot</a> and use Nvidia’s Jetson robotic technology. You’ll <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNfRgZMWyCI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">see them at Disney parks</a>, and eventually, you’ll be able to buy one.</p>\n<p>This little guy is the closest to a real “Star Wars”-like robot I’ve ever found. I wish I’d been smart enough to invest in Lucas Films back then rather than spending my money on going to that first “Star Wars” movie over and over and over again. BDX showcased how far robotics has come, and we’ll be seeing a lot of amazing robots you can buy in 2025.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-year_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Nvidia Blackwell GPU</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/nvidia-blackwell-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia Blackwell Architecture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/nvidia-blackwell-architecture.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/nvidia-blackwell-architecture-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/nvidia-blackwell-architecture-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Nvidia</p>\n<p>When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMIRhOXAjYk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">presented Blackwell</a>, it was a fantastic event that showcased how a company should release a revolutionary product. This GPU is massive in terms of performance and power requirements, and it is forcing a gigantic pivot from air to water cooling in cloud and enterprise data centers as the world pivots to AI.</p>\n<p>The backstory on this part and Nvidia’s entire AI effort is a tale of legend. Back in the early 2000s, when only IBM was really working with AI, Jensen Huang became convinced it was a much more near-term future event. For much of the next 20 years, Nvidia’s financial performance dragged as the company basically bet its future on AI. Had Huang not been a founder, he likely would have been fired.</p>\n<p>Then OpenAI asked for help, and Nvidia provided it. Thanks to Nvidia, we now have generative AI that works. Blackwell is the current culmination of this work, a massive GPU that is extremely power-hungry but also incredibly efficient. While it uses a ton of power, it does much more work than any group of other GPUs or NPUs can do with that same power.</p>\n<p>AMD’s Threadripper CPU was equally innovative, but it was designed for existing market needs. Nvidia was working on Blackwell before AI became a market, and that’s just never done. By taking what seemed to be an unreasonable risk and executing on it, Nvidia caught its competitors sleeping, and now Nvidia is nearly synonymous with AI.</p>\n<p>Back when there were pensions, CEO compensation was more reasonable, and boards more supportive of long-term strategic moves, an effort like this wouldn’t have been that unusual. But in today’s world, you just don’t see that.</p>\n<p>Nvidia’s Blackwell effort gave me hope that the U.S. might be able to return to a more strategic future. It caught the imagination of a world increasingly focused on and concerned about AI. Blackwell was a once-in-a-generation leap in performance and a massive bet that could have gone badly, so it is my choice for Product of the Year.</p>\n\n",

As part of their fraudulent hiring process, he continued, the phishing campaign tricks victims into downloading a malicious application that acts as a dropper, eventually installing AppLite.</p>\n<p>“The attackers behind this phishing campaign demonstrated a remarkable level of adaptability, leveraging diverse and sophisticated social engineering strategies to target their victims,” Pratapagiri wrote.</p>\n<p>A key tactic employed by the attackers involves masquerading as a job recruiter or HR representatives from well-known organizations, he continued. Victims are enticed to respond to fraudulent emails, carefully crafted to resemble authentic job offers or requests for additional information.</p>\n<p>“People are desperate to get a job, so when they see remote work, good pay, good benefits, they text back,” noted Steve Levy, principal talent advisor with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dhigroupinc.com/\">DHI Group</a>, parent company of Dice, a career marketplace for candidates seeking technology-focused roles and employers looking to hire tech talent globally, in Centennial, Colo.</p>\n<p>“That starts the snowball rolling,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It’s called pig butchering.

We’re seeing this on LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram.”</p>\n<p>“Not only are these scams common, they’re very insidious,” he declared. “They prey on the emotional situation of job seekers.”</p>\n<p>“I probably get three to four of these text inquiries a week,” he continued. “They all go into my junk folder automatically. These are the new versions of the Nigerian prince emails that ask you to send them $1,000, and they’ll give you $10 million back.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Beyond its ability to mimic enterprise companies, AppLite can also masquerade as Chrome and TikTok apps, demonstrating a wide range of target vectors, including full device takeover and application access.</p>\n<p>“The level of access provided [to] the attackers could also include corporate credentials, application, and data if the device was used by the user for remote work or access for their existing employer,” Pratapagiri wrote.</p>\n<p>“As mobile devices have become essential to business operations, securing them is crucial, especially to protect against the large variety of different types of phishing attacks, including these sophisticated mobile-targeted phishing attempts,” said Patrick Tiquet, vice president for security and architecture of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company, in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“Organizations should implement robust mobile device management policies, ensuring that both corporate-issued and BYOD devices comply with security standards,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Regular updates to both devices and security software will ensure that vulnerabilities are promptly patched, safeguarding against known threats that target mobile users.”</p>\n<p>Aalto also recommended the adoption of human risk management (HRM) platforms to tackle the growing sophistication of mobile phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>“When a new attack is reported by an employee, the HRM platform learns to automatically find future similar attacks,” he said. “By integrating HRM, organizations can create a more resilient security culture where users become active defenders against mobile phishing and smishing attacks.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Robotaxi services are spreading <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/lyft-bringing-robotaxis-to-dallas-179584.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">broadly</a>. While they’ve clearly had issues in San Francisco — as have I, driving in San Francisco — those challenges are improving. Now, both Uber and Lyft appear to be taking steps toward replacing their ride-share drivers with AI.</p>\n<p>We may be on the verge of one of the first large-scale AI job replacement efforts that everyone will witness. This transition will fix a key issue with ride-sharing by aligning revenue more directly with its users. However, it won’t address a deeper problem that ride-sharing has in common with social media: a decoupled revenue business model — where the people using a service aren’t necessarily funding it.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about decoupled revenue. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week: a new and awesome notebook from Lenovo that sports a brand-new processor from Intel.</p>\n<h3>The Problem With Decoupled Revenue</h3>\n<p>The problem with both social media and ride-sharing is that the people paying for the service aren’t treated as the primary customers.</p>\n<p>With social media, advertisers fund the platforms, but users engage with content as if they were the primary customers. With ride-sharing, the platform enables car owners to monetize their vehicles, but that’s a cost of the service. Since riders are the ones paying, they should be the customers of the drivers, not the platform.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the platform prioritizes those who provide the revenue—advertisers for social media and riders for ride-sharing—while those who power the service, such as content creators and drivers, are treated as cost centers rather than valued participants.</p>\n<p>This decoupling means that those who make the service possible — like Uber/Lyft drivers and social media users — are often overlooked. Their needs are subordinated to those of the entities providing the funding, like advertisers on social media and riders for Uber/Lyft. Instead of being seen as assets to be optimized, social media content creators and ride-share drivers are frequently treated as problems to be managed.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Both conditions are true. Users drive the advertising revenue because ads are worthless without users. Likewise, if there aren’t any drivers, there is nothing for riders to use.</p>\n<p>Managers often fail to make this distinction. I once knew a general manager who argued that his plant would run much better without sales reps mucking things up — forgetting they were the reason the plant had business in the first place. He was fired shortly thereafter because he was an idiot, but this wasn’t a unique situation. I was an internal auditor, and it was surprising how many high-ranking executives didn’t seem to know how things actually worked — which is kind of scary when you think about it.</p>\n<p>Businesses generally function better when the people using a service and those funding it are the same. When revenue and users are decoupled, as they are in social media and ride-sharing, platforms risk alienating the people who keep them running. You don’t mess with your revenue sources.</p>\n<h3>Will Robotaxis Disrupt or Fix Ride-Sharing?</h3>\n<p>Robotaxis may fix ride-share or badly break it. If Uber and Lyft go to robotaxi services, then the people who use this service to monetize their cars are kind of screwed unless they want to work for nearly free because they won’t be able to compete with an AI driver. However, this would also eliminate the problem the drivers represent in terms of being treated more like a cost center than a customer. With robotaxis, Uber and Lyft can just focus on the riders who then become their customers.</p>\n<p>Now, I know these services have been considering allowing ride-share car owners to stay with the service but buy and maintain the autonomous vehicles themselves, enabling them to earn back a significant part of the revenue. That could resemble a B&amp;B model, but with cars and trucks, maintenance, insurance, and liability concerns create additional hurdles.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Plus, while these cars will essentially be electric, we don’t have automated charging stations for them to use. Charging infrastructure is critical if autonomous vehicles operate independently, and solutions like robotic charging or battery swaps are still in development.</p>\n<p>Given these challenges, Uber and Lyft will likely choose to own their fleets and install unique charging ports, automated charging stations, and stand-by parking lots to accommodate typical fluctuations in demand throughout the day.</p>\n<h3>Initially, There Would Be a Blend</h3>\n<p>Right now, robotaxi service technology is suitable for urban areas. However, if the rider needs to go some distance, then, at least in the short term, a human driver would still be needed until we have approved autonomous driving technology that can operate within and between cities.</p>\n<p>We might even see some integration between autonomous cars and airplanes for service within a state. At least some of the aircraft being considered for this are VTOL (vertical take-off and landing), which provides the potential for more localized landing pads where riders could transfer from their autonomous car to an autonomous plane.</p>\n<p>There have also been some <a href=\"https://robbreport.com/motors/aviation/drone-audi-concept-transforms-flying-car-2831240/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concepts</a> where an autonomous lifting body attaches to the car when it needs to bypass traffic or travel longer distances. That would be cool, but I think safety concerns might keep people from wanting to use it. I recall a <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/43549/the-tragic-story-of-the-flying-ford-pinto-ended-exactly-how-youd-expect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flying car</a> many years ago based on a Ford Pinto where the wings and car came apart at altitude, killing the company’s founders.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>While robotaxis may improve ride-sharing by better aligning revenue with users, what happens to the displaced Uber and Lyft drivers? In some cases — and Tesla is exploring this — some may work remotely, taking control when a robotaxi runs into trouble to guide it to safety or a repair station. But this would require far fewer drivers than today, offering only temporary employment for some, while most would be out of luck.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> As AIs move in to take over more of these jobs, figuring out what to do with the people who have lost theirs as a result will be an increasingly complex problem. What happens to drivers, or even pilots, when vehicles can drive or fly themselves? It isn’t like you can suddenly pivot all of them to robot trainers. We don’t need nearly as many trainers as we now have drivers and pilots.</p>\n<p>For us users, things will become much more convenient with lower prices, better service, and less concern about whether your driver is a serial killer. (I watch too many police TV shows!) There will be fewer interesting conversations, although, come to think of it, generative AI is conversational, so you might be able to talk to the car during your ride, and it will certainly be less likely to be abusing drugs or reading messages instead of focusing on the road.</p>\n<p>The experience should be cheaper, safer, and far more convenient, which will fix the decoupled revenue problem.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i Prototype</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179596\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179596\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-Ideapad-Pro-5i.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo Ideapad Pro 5i\n16-inch laptop\" width=\"400\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-Ideapad-Pro-5i.jpg 400w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Lenovo-Ideapad-Pro-5i-300x261.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179596\"><span>Photo by Author</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i prototype is pretty awesome. The shipping version of this laptop uses Nvidia RTX graphics, but this one uses Intel ARC and isn’t due until July.</p>\n<p>This AI PC, one of Intel’s first, uses the 9u processor — also called the Ultra 9 processor. It has a 16-inch OLED screen that looks awesome, and OLEDs have become more efficient, so they aren’t the huge battery killers they once were.</p>\n<p>I prefer a larger screen because I generally work off a desktop machine, so going down to a 14-inch or even 13-inch is incredibly painful. Fifteen inches is fine, but that extra inch on a 16-inch makes a noticeable and positive difference.</p>\n<p>The downside is I can’t really work on this laptop on a plane. Still, I generally just watch movies when I’m flying because I need time to unwind and chill out since I just don’t feel like working every single moment anymore, and films on this screen are incredible.</p>\n<p>When this laptop ships, the price should be around $1,500 (this could change with tariffs), which is reasonable for a 16-inch OLED with discrete graphics. Intel ARC graphics use a blend of AMD’s and Nvidia’s approaches to upscaling, and, in their stand-alone cards, ARC represents one of the better values in GPUs. The IdeaPad Pro 5i is the first laptop I’ve seen with these graphics.</p>\n<p>The drivers on this prototype were undergoing some changes, but I’d expect between 10 and 20 hours of battery life depending on use, which would be huge for a 16-inch laptop.</p>\n<p>The graphics are more than adequate for my needs. There still isn’t a lot of desktop AI stuff outside Office 365. So, while its NPU is light, with 11 TOPS compared to over 40 for other AI PCs, the total TOPS is close to 100, with the GPU contributing additional AI processing power.</p>\n<p>The downside is that this laptop won’t run Recall or Cocreator until Microsoft enables those. Recall is on hold and only available in trial form, although I’ve found ChatGPT’s Dalle-E web implementation to be just fine. (Microsoft could enable Dall-E on laptops with discrete graphics; it’s only a matter of time). Given how fast AI is advancing, it is nice to have an AI PC from Intel because most companies still test Intel hardware, which is better to ensure a positive outcome.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a very nice product. Mine, pictured above, came in silver-black. It is attractive, useful, and well-priced, making the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i prototype with ARC graphics my Product of the Week. Sorry — you won’t be able to buy one for yourself until July.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Some software developers disagree with the open-source community on licensing and compliance issues, arguing that the community needs to redefine what constitutes free open-source code.</p>\n<p>The term “open washing” has emerged, referring to what some industry experts claim is the practice of AI companies misusing the “open source” label. As the artificial intelligence rush intensifies, efforts to redefine terms for AI processes have only added to the confusion.</p>\n<p>Recent accusations that Meta “open washed” the description of its <a href=\"https://www.llama.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Llama</a> AI model as true open source fueled the latest volley in the technical confrontation. Some in the industry, like Ann Schlemmer, CEO of open-source database firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com\">Percona</a>, have suggested that open-source licensing be replaced with a “fair source” designation.</p>\n<p>Schlemmer, a strong advocate for adherence to open-source principles, expressed concern over the potential misuse of open-source terminology. She wants clear definitions and guardrails for AI’s inclusion in open source that align with understanding the core principles of open-source software.</p>\n<p>“What does open-source software mean when it comes to AI models? [It refers to] the code is available, here’s the licensing, and here’s what you can do with it. Then we are piling on AI,” she told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>The use of AI data is being mixed in as if it were software, which is where the confusion within the industry originates.</p>\n<p>“Well, the data is not the software. Data is data. There are already privacy laws to regulate that use,” she added.</p>\n<h3>New Definition for Open-Source AI Systems</h3>\n<p>The <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://opensource.org\">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) released an updated definition for open-source AI systems on Oct. 28, encouraging organizations to do more instead of slapping the “open source” term on AI work. OSI is a California-based public benefit corporation that promotes open source worldwide.</p>\n<p>In a published interview elsewhere, OSI’s Executive Director Stefano Maffulli said that Meta’s labeling of the Llama foundation model as open source confuses users and pollutes the open-source concept. This action occurs as governments and agencies, including the European Union, increasingly support open-source software.</p>\n<p>In response, OSI issued the first version of <a href=\"https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Source AI Definition 1.0</a> (OSAID) to define what qualifies as open-source software more explicitly. The document follows a year-long global community design process. It offers a standard for community-led, open, and public evaluations to validate whether an AI system can be deemed open-source AI.</p>\n<p>“The co-design process that led to version 1.0 of the Open Source AI Definition was well-developed, thorough, inclusive, and fair,” said Carlo Piana, OSI board chair, in the press release.</p>\n<p>The new definition requires open source models to provide enough information to enable a skilled person to use training data to recreate a substantially equivalent system using the same or similar data, noted Ayah Bdeir, lead for AI strategy at Mozilla, in the OSI announcement.</p>\n<p>“[It] goes further than what many proprietary or ostensibly open source models do today,” she said. “This is the starting point to addressing the complexities of how AI training data should be treated, acknowledging the challenges of sharing full datasets while working to make open datasets a more commonplace part of the AI ecosystem.”</p>\n<p>The text of the OSAID v.1.0 and a partial list of the global stakeholders endorsing the definition are available on the <a href=\"https://opensource.org/ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OSI website</a>.</p>\n<h3>Dissension Over OSI’s Open-Source AI Definition</h3>\n<p>Schlemmer, who did not participate in writing OSI’s open-source definition, said she and others have concerns about the OSI content. OSAID does not resolve all the issues, she contended, and some content needs to be backtracked.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, this is not said and done right, even by their own admitting. That reception has been overwhelming, but not in the positive sense,” Schlemmer added.</p>\n<p>She compared the growing practice of loosely referring to something as an open-source product to what occurs in other industries. For example, the food industry uses the words “organic” or “natural” to suggest an assumption of a product’s contents or benefit to consumers.</p>\n<p>“How much [of labeling a software product open source] is a marketing ploy?” she questioned.</p>\n<h3>Is Changing Definition an Enforcement Solution?</h3>\n<p>Open-source supporters often boast about how the technology is deployed globally. Only rarely is an issue cited about license enforcement issues.</p>\n<p>Schlemmer admitted that economic pressures drive changes in open-source licenses. It often becomes a balancing act between sharing free open-source code and monetizing software development.</p>\n<p>For example, companies like MongoDB, her own Percona, and Elastic have adapted their licensing strategies to balance commercial interests with open-source principles. In these cases, license violations or enforcement were not involved.</p>\n<p>“Several tools exist in the ecosystem, and compliance groups in corporate departments help people be compliant. Particularly in the larger organizations, there are frameworks,” said Schlemmer.</p>\n<p>Individual developers may not recognize all those nuances. However, many license changes are based on determining the economic value of the project’s original owner.</p>\n<h3>Reaffirming True Open-Source Standards</h3>\n<p>Schlemmer is optimistic about the future of open source. Developers can build upon open-source code without violating licenses. However, changes in licensing can limit their ability to monetize.</p>\n<p>These concerns highlight the potential erosion of open-source adoption due to license changes and the need for ongoing vigilance. She cautioned that it will take continuous evolution of open-source licensing and adaptation to new technologies and market pressures to resolve lingering issues.</p>\n<p>“We must keep going back to the core tenet of open-source software and be very clear as to what that means and doesn’t mean,” Schlemmer recommended. “What problem are we trying to solve as technology evolves?”</p>\n<p>Some of those challenges have already been addressed, she added. We have a framework for the open-source definition with clear labels and licenses.</p>\n<p>“So, what’s this new concept? Why does what we already have no longer apply when we reference back?”</p>\n<p>That is what needs to be aligned.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>High-powered computer chip maker Nvidia on Monday unveiled a new AI model developed by its researchers that can generate or transform any mix of music, voices and sounds described with prompts using any combination of text and audio files.</p>\n<p>The new AI model called Fugatto — for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus — can create a music snippet based on a text prompt, remove or add instruments from an existing song, change the accent or emotion in a voice, and even produce sounds never heard before.</p>\n<p>According to Nvidia, by supporting numerous audio generation and transformation tasks, Fugatto is the first foundational generative AI model that showcases emergent properties — capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities — and the ability to combine free-form instructions.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to create a model that understands and generates sound like humans do,” Rafael Valle, a manager of applied audio research at Nvidia, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Fugatto is our first step toward a future where unsupervised multitask learning in audio synthesis and transformation emerges from data and model scale,” he added.</p>\n<p>Nvidia noted the model is capable of handling tasks it was not pretrained on, as well as generating sounds that change over time, such as the Doppler effect of thunder as a rainstorm passes through an area.</p>\n<p>The company added that unlike most models, which can only recreate the training data they’ve been exposed to, Fugatto allows users to create soundscapes it’s never seen before, such as a thunderstorm easing into dawn with the sound of birds singing.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough AI Model for Audio Transformation</h3>\n<p>“Nvidia’s introduction of Fugatto marks a significant advancement in AI-driven audio technology,” observed Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://riseopp.com\">RiseOpp</a>, a national CMO services company based in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“Unlike existing models that specialize in specific tasks — such as music composition, voice synthesis, or sound effect generation — Fugatto offers a unified framework capable of handling a diverse array of audio-related functions,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This versatility positions it as a comprehensive tool for audio synthesis and transformation.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Vahdat explained that Fugatto distinguishes itself through its ability to generate and transform audio based on both text instructions and optional audio inputs. “This dual-input approach enables users to create complex audio outputs that seamlessly blend various elements, such as combining a saxophone’s melody with the timbre of a meowing cat,” he said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, he continued, Fugatto’s capacity to interpolate between instructions allows for nuanced control over attributes like accent and emotion in voice synthesis, offering a level of customization not commonly found in current AI audio tools.</p>\n<p>“Fugatto is an extraordinary step towards AI that can handle multiple modalities simultaneously,” added <a href=\"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benjamin Lee</a>, a professor of engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>“Using both text and audio inputs together may produce far more efficient or effective models than using text alone,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The technology is interesting because, looking beyond text alone, it broadens the volumes of training data and the capabilities of generative AI models.”</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Audio AI Fugatto Generates Sound from Text | NVIDIA Research\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qj1Sp8He6e4\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Nvidia at Its Best</h3>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, asserted that Fugatto represents Nvidia at its best.</p>\n<p>“The technology introduces advanced capabilities in AI audio processing by enabling the transformation of existing audio into entirely new forms,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This includes converting a piano melody into a human vocal line or altering the accent and emotional tone of spoken words, offering unprecedented flexibility in audio manipulation.”</p>\n<p>“Unlike existing AI audio tools, Fugatto can generate novel sounds from text descriptions, such as making a trumpet sound like a barking dog,” he said. “These features provide creators in music, film, and gaming with innovative tools for sound design and audio editing.”</p>\n<p>Fugatto deals with audio holistically — spanning sound effects, music, voice, virtually any type of audio, including sounds that have not been heard before — and precisely, added Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>He cited the example of <a href=\"https://suno.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Suno</a>, a service that uses AI to generate songs. “They just released a new version that has improvements in how generated human voices sound and other things, but it doesn’t allow the kinds of precise, creative changes that Fugatto allows, such as adding new instruments to a mix, changing moods from happy to sad, or moving a song from a minor key to a major key,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Its understanding of the world of audio and the flexibility that it offers goes beyond the mask-specific engines that we’ve seen for things like generating a human voice or generating a song,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Opens Door for Creatives</h3>\n<p>Vahdat pointed out that Fugatto can be useful in both advertising and language learning. Agencies can create customized audio content that aligns with brand identities, including voiceovers with specific accents or emotional tones, he noted.</p>\n<p>At the same time, in language learning, educational platforms will be able to develop personalized audio materials, such as dialogues in various accents or emotional contexts, to aid in language acquisition.</p>\n<p>“Fugatto technology opens doors to a wide array of applications in creative industries,” Vena maintained. “Filmmakers and game developers can use it to create unique soundscapes, such as turning everyday sounds into fantastical or immersive effects,” he said. “It also holds potential for personalized audio experiences in virtual reality, assistive technologies, and education, tailoring sounds to specific emotional tones or user preferences.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“In music production,” he added, “it can transform instruments or vocal styles to explore innovative compositions.”</p>\n<p>Further development may be needed to get better musical results, however. “All these results are trivial, and some have been around for longer — and better,” observed <a href=\"https://maltedmedia.com/people/bathory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dennis Bathory-Kitsz</a>, a musician and composer in Northfield Falls, Vt.</p>\n<p>“The voice isolation was clumsy and unmusical,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The additional instruments were also trivial, and most of the transformations were colorless. The only advantage is that it requires no particular learning, so the development of musicality for the AI user will be minimal.”</p>\n<p>“It may usher in some new uses — real musicians are wonderfully inventive already — but unless the developers have better musical chops to begin with, the results will be dreary,” he said. “They will be musical slop to join the visual and verbal slop from AI.”</p>\n<h3>AGI Stand-In</h3>\n<p>With artificial general intelligence (AGI) still very much in the future, Fugatto may be a model for simulating AGI, which ultimately aims to replicate or surpass human cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks.</p>\n<p>“Fugatto is part of a solution that uses generative AI in a collaborative bundle with other AI tools to create an AGI-like solution,” explained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“Until we get AGI working,” he told TechNewsWorld, “this approach will be the dominant way to create more complete AI projects with far higher quality and interest.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I’ve been attending and covering HP’s partner events like <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/newsroom/press-releases/2025/driving-the-future-together-hp-amplify-conference-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amplify</a> for decades, and it has always struck me that HP treats its partners like family.</p>\n<p>That kind of partner relationship is vastly different from what I’ve seen at other companies I’ve worked for — firms that claim to value partners but often treat them like a burden they’d rather not deal with. HP’s approach should be the standard. Instead, it is the exception. Enrique Lores is a unique CEO, and while HP has had some problematic CEOs, Lores embodies the empathy and customer focus of HP’s founders.</p>\n<p>It is rare to see a CEO mingling with attendees, soliciting feedback, and engaging in meaningful conversations at events. Typically, CEOs retreat to the background after a brief appearance on stage, leaving the spotlight to others.</p>\n<p>However, HP’s Amplify partner event was different. It was marked by the unusual presence of HP’s CEO, who actively roamed the event floor, interacting with partners and attendees alike. This level of engagement was unprecedented and set the tone for a truly remarkable experience.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about HP Amplify this week. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, an upcoming notebook from HP that uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon solution correctly — which, sadly, is also an exception.</p>\n<h3>HP’s Focus on End Users and Partners</h3>\n<p>The HP Amplify event was unusual not only because of the CEO’s approachability but also because of its extreme focus on end users and partners.</p>\n<p>Unlike many industry events that primarily showcase engineering feats and product specifications, Amplify prioritized the experiences and needs of its customers and partners.</p>\n<p>HP demonstrated a commendable dedication to understanding and addressing the real-world applications and challenges faced by those who use its products daily.</p>\n<h3>AI Tools Streamline Customer, Partner Service</h3>\n<p>Internally, HP has been pioneering the aggressive use of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>\n<p>At Amplify, the demonstration of AI tools designed to streamline the process of matching customers and partners with the right products was particularly noteworthy.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>These AI solutions enhance the efficiency and accuracy of product recommendations, ensuring that the end users receive the most suitable options to meet their needs.</p>\n<p>This focus on AI extends beyond internal operations, showcasing HP’s commitment to leveraging advanced technologies to improve customer satisfaction.</p>\n<h3>PC and Printer Security</h3>\n<p>HP’s leadership in security was evident across both its PC and printer lines. With a strong emphasis on protecting user data and ensuring safe operations, HP continues to innovate in this critical area.</p>\n<p>Its unique Quantum Safe printer offerings represent a significant leap forward in safeguarding sensitive information. These printers are designed to address the emerging threats of quantum computing, ensuring they remain secure even as technology evolves.</p>\n<h3>Expanding AI PC Product Lines</h3>\n<p>In an impressive move, HP announced the introduction of 60 new AI PC products. This significant expansion positions HP at the forefront of the desktop AI PC market.</p>\n<p>By focusing on desktop AI capabilities, HP is not only catering to current market demands but also paving the way for future dominance.</p>\n<p>This initiative highlights HP’s strategic approach to incorporating AI into its product development, ensuring it remains competitive and innovative.</p>\n<h3>Employee Care: A Legacy of Compassion</h3>\n<p>HP’s unique focus on employee care was another highlight of the Amplify event. This mindset is not a recent development but a foundational principle dating back to the company’s inception.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The company’s commitment to its employees is reflected in various initiatives and policies aimed at ensuring their well-being and professional growth. This approach fosters a positive work environment and contributes to the company’s overall success.</p>\n<h3>Sustainability and Product Reuse</h3>\n<p>HP’s advancements in product reuse and a market-leading focus on sustainability were prominently showcased at Amplify.</p>\n<p>The company has made significant strides in reducing environmental impact through innovative practices and sustainable product designs. HP’s dedication to sustainability is evident in its efforts to create products that are not only efficient but also environmentally responsible.</p>\n<h3>HP Supply Chain Prepared for Disruption</h3>\n<p>HP’s proactive logistics pivot in anticipation of the trade wars has positioned it as arguably the best-prepared vendor in the industry.</p>\n<p>By adapting logistics strategies to mitigate potential disruptions, HP has ensured continuity and reliability in its supply chain. This level of preparedness demonstrates HP’s foresight and strategic planning capabilities, making it a dependable partner in uncertain times.</p>\n<h3>Training Partner AIs: Empowering Through Knowledge</h3>\n<p>One of the most compelling aspects of HP’s strategy is its dedication to training partner AIs. By focusing on desktop AI, HP is uniquely positioned to help users understand and maximize the potential of personal AI capabilities.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This educational approach ensures that partners and end users are equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world.</p>\n<h3>HP CEO Honored for Ethical Leadership</h3>\n<p>At the core of HP’s business philosophy is the belief that doing good leads to doing well. This principle was exemplified by HP CEO Enrique Lores’ recent recognition with the <a href=\"https://justcapital.com/news/hp-inc-president-and-ceo-enrique-lores-receives-inaugural-just-capital-lifetime-achievement-award/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> from Just Capital — a prestigious accolade that underscores HP’s commitment to empathy, heart, and ethical business practices.</p>\n<p>The award is a testament to the company’s dedication to making a positive impact on society while achieving business success.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Key Takeaways From HP Amplify 2025</h3>\n<p>HP’s Amplify partner event was a remarkable showcase of innovation, strategic thinking, and heartfelt commitment to both customers and partners.</p>\n<p>From the CEO’s hands-on engagement to the company’s focus on AI, security, sustainability, and employee care, HP demonstrated why it is a leader in the industry.</p>\n<p>As HP continues to push the boundaries of technology and prioritize the well-being of its stakeholders, HP proves that the company you want to do business with is one that cares deeply about doing good to do well.</p>\n<p>So, the next time you see a CEO asking attendees for feedback, you might want to pinch yourself and make sure you’re not dreaming. If you are dreaming, let’s hope it’s about HP’s innovative products and its CEO winning awards for being such a compassionate leader.</p>\n<p>Because with HP, reality really does feel like a dream.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\"></p>\n<h3>HP EliteBook 6 G1q</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HP-EliteBook-6-G1q-14-inch-AI-PC.jpg\" alt=\"HP EliteBook 6 G1q 14-inch AI PC\" width=\"686\" height=\"569\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HP-EliteBook-6-G1q-14-inch-AI-PC.jpg 686w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HP-EliteBook-6-G1q-14-inch-AI-PC-300x249.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: HP</p>\n<p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon laptop solution was uniquely positioned to benefit from Microsoft’s AI PC effort, but Qualcomm’s strength isn’t in processors; it’s in connectivity. While the processor was impressive, decoupling it from the 5G modem significantly weakened the offering.</p>\n<p>The issue with 5G modems is that they aren’t extremely popular. However, I expect that will change as we advance AI use because, today, most AI capability is in the cloud, not on the PC, which makes the connectivity option far more critical.</p>\n<p>The upcoming HP EliteBook 6 G1q includes a modem and features HP Go, a service that connects you instantly for about $20 per month. I’ve used 5G laptops in the past, and they can be a godsend when Wi-Fi isn’t available or when it sucks.</p>\n<p>As you would expect, this laptop has massive battery life, meaning you can leave your power supply behind (the last Qualcomm laptop I had could go several days without needing a charge), and Qualcomm’s latest has far greater compatibility. The penalty for running it in emulation (for applications that aren’t native) has dropped to around 4%, which most folks won’t even notice.</p>\n<p>I haven’t had a chance to use the laptop yet, and we’re still waiting on pricing and availability. Still, this is what Qualcomm-based AI PCs should have always been.</p>\n<p>With Microsoft finally releasing <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/apis/recall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recall</a>, which runs continuously, I expect this product to shine very well competitively, so it’s my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The MakuluLinux LinDoz 2025 edition is one of the most useful and functional AI-powered Linux distributions available. Based on a heavily modified version of the Cinnamon desktop and the latest Debian testing version, it offers free and unlimited access to a loaded AI toolkit.</p>\n<p>AI is slowly making its way into computer and smartphone devices, and the Linux OS is no exception. However, AI is still not mainstream. This typically takes various forms, such as smarter system management tools, enhanced command-line interfaces, and even some experimental desktop features.</p>\n<p>Some Linux distributions dabble more in AI than others, offering a subtle focus on performance and resource management and integrating AI into the desktop. However, Jacque Montague Raymer, developer of MakuluLinux, goes far beyond any AI subtleties.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, Raymer started pushing traditional Linux boundaries by introducing AI features for regular users. He combined unusual in-house adaptations of several desktop designs in various releases with overlapping features in primary OS releases named Max, LinDoz, and Shift.</p>\n<p>LinDoz 2025 positions MakuluLinux in direct competition with ChatGPT. This is the primary attraction to using his modified Cinnamon desktop. Even users who are not fans of this desktop will find enough personalization and configuration options to blur the otherwise heavy influence of Microsoft Windows-like look and feel.</p>\n<p>Raymer admits he had to overcome many challenges with integrating full AI solutions into Linux. Dealing with open-source collaboration, ensuring privacy, and making these features user-friendly for a wide range of skill levels comprised some of the obstacles.</p>\n<p>Dancing around constant issues with Ubuntu-based architecture, he finally built this current release on Debian Linux.</p>\n<h3>Serving Two Code Bases No Easy Feat</h3>\n<p>As Raymer describes the challenges, he maintains two code bases for his distributions: Debian and Ubuntu. He continually develops on both fronts.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really know which will be the one we will release until the final few months before the actual release. Both Ubuntu and Debian go through their mood swings. One year one is more stable and plays nice. The next year, it’s the other,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>Last year’s development cycle was a nightmare working on the Ubuntu base with Python, which is a big part of his AI development project. More on this later.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Ubuntu kept dumping Python updates into their repositories that did not play nicely with our development. The Debian base had none of these issues. The Debian base is more stable and offers the benefit of rolling or semi-rolling releases. Debian has gotten a lot better with driver support. That was another big factor I took into account,” he explained.</p>\n<h3>‘Electrifying’ AI Development Reached Pinnacle in Latest Release</h3>\n<p>What distinguishes LinDoz from other Linux OSes offering AI features is the Electra platform. Unlike subscription services or AI plug-ins with limited functionality used by other distros, “she” is a unique platform with a video image and personality built into the interface.</p>\n<p>“Electra is some clever coding and a series of models. She is not one single model that you can execute and run,” noted Raymer. “We take carefully selected models and run them through a training system that we designed over the last two years.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Electra.jpg\" alt=\"Electra in LinDoz 2025\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\"></p>\n<p>Electra has a visual form to go with a natural-sounding human voice within the AI-integrated Makulu Linux 2025 distro.</p>\n<p>This provides Electra’s “brain” with additional learning beyond core training. The models are chosen based on their best usage cases, and the core training system decides which model to use for the end user’s needs.</p>\n<p>The result is Electra, which is essentially a new model with additional data. So, if the user needs to generate images, Electra calls up one of several image models, applies the image training data to the selected model, and then generates the image. According to Raymer, it works the same way for text, coding, audio generation, video generation, text-to-voice, and language translation.</p>\n<p>“So, what is Electra? She is a core system of training scripts that run on 27 server connections that we built over a two-year period that takes advantage of various models to give access to text, image, audio, and video generation, all within the same system,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“We are able to offer free AI access because we run Electra on our server boxes and don’t go through OpenAI,” Raymer disclosed.</p>\n<h3>Why LinDoz Stands Out Among MakuluLinux Editions</h3>\n<p>Since the distribution was created in January 2019, I have been a fan of the various evolving MakuluLinux releases. MakuluLinux comes in three flavors: LinDoz, Max, and Shift. LinDoz currently offers the most features and AI services.</p>\n<p>MakuluLinux has long been one of my favorite Linux offerings. Many of its features do not merely mimic those in other Linux distros. They combine and improve them to the point of contributing to a unique and innovative computing platform.</p>\n<p>Raymer’s innovative customizations to the Cinnamon desktop make an irresistible Linux experience, especially as an alternative to Windows 10/11.</p>\n<p>The Cinnamon desktop has the same Conky calendar and system monitoring views as previous editions of MakuluLinux. However, standard Cinnamon lacks the Conky visuals anchored to the desktop and has a non-traditional appearance.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/LinDoz-2025-Cinnamon-desktop.jpg\" alt=\"LinDoz 2025 Cinnamon desktop screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\"></p>\n<p>This is the classic Cinnamon desktop, with a transparent bottom panel and Conky system monitor display. It shows many of the specialized AI-based applications not available in standard Linux offerings.</p>\n<p>Some noteworthy design alterations deserve mentioning. One is that the bottom panel stays transparent until you open an application full screen. Unmaximize it, and the panel returns to its transparent look.</p>\n<p>Another is the innovative tweaking of AI, and the Virtual Webcam features that already exist in the MakuluLinux Shift and Max distros. However, their more advanced development and expansion here will be the primary attractions for new users of this uniquely different Linux operating system.</p>\n<h3>More Cool Stuff Inside LinDoz 2025</h3>\n<p>A <em>big</em> breakthrough added a few weeks after the 2025 release and already updated is the Universal Language Translator AI-powered app. It is a handy tool for Linux users who want to communicate on the internet without language barriers or conduct business conversations across borders. It runs with Voice and is very easy to use.</p>\n<p>A related and really cool feature is the messenger app. Dozens of supported languages come with voice packs, so you cannot only talk across borders but also enable voice and sit and listen to conversations in chat in your native tongue, no matter what language the other person is speaking.</p>\n<p>Previous versions lacked complete business suites to handle Word and spreadsheet documents, like LibreOffice. Users were left to find and install their own. This current release makes up for that and then some.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/LinDoz-2025-Text-Editor.jpg\" alt=\"LinDoz 2025 AI-Powered Text Editor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\"></p>\n<p>Whether using a full office suite or a simple text editor, just click the task button at the bottom of the app window. Results will appear literally seconds later.</p>\n<p>Raymer modified Collabora Office, an open-source suite based on LibreOffice, to integrate Electra’s writing and image generation capabilities directly into the document editor.</p>\n<h3>Electra’s Magic Comes Alive</h3>\n<p>In some of the videos Raymer created, he shows how easy it is to tell Electra simple prompts to translate language, generate code, compose literature, or write music.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Electra-coder.jpg\" alt=\"Electra coder screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"540\"></p>\n<p>Working with Electra is easy using graphical user interfaces like this or terminal windows.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Electra-coder-poem-result.jpg\" alt=\"Electra coder poem result\" width=\"1000\" height=\"531\"></p>\n<p>Raymer gave Electra a 10-word prompt to write a poem about Star Trek.

      "content": "<p>Quantum computing made significant strides in 2024, but it’s yet to demonstrate a practical advantage over classical digital computers, according to a recent trends report released by <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester Research</a>.</p>\n<p>“Despite improvements in qubit count, coherence time, and gate fidelity, the technology remains experimental, with broad-scale applications likely still a decade away,” maintained the report written by Forrester Vice President for Emerging Technologies Brian Hopkins and Principal Analyst David Mooter, with Stephanie Balaouras, Mike Gualtieri, Charlie Dai, James McGlynn, and Jen Barton.</p>\n<p>“Key developments in optimization, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning show promise for specific industries like finance and pharmaceuticals, yet challenges such as high error rates and scalability persist,” the analysts added.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogeragrimes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roger A. Grimes</a>, author of “Cryptography Apocalypse: Preparing for the Day When Quantum Computing Breaks Today’s Crypto,” published by Wiley, acknowledged that practical, usable quantum computers haven’t made a public appearance yet, but some useful applications of quantum have been deployed, such as quantum random number generators, networks, sensors, and all sorts of other devices.</p>\n<p>“No one has publicly shown a problem solved by a quantum computer that is super usable in the real world,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Today, your wristwatch has more power than what we have in quantum computers. But that is changing. We are making steady progress, and the day when quantum computers turn into sufficiently-capable quantum computers is not far away.”</p>\n<h3>Quantum Solving Problems Now</h3>\n<p>Trevor Lanting, chief development officer at D-Wave Systems in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, agreed that gate-model quantum computing has not yet demonstrated a practical quantum advantage but pointed out that annealing quantum computing is delivering value over classical computing today.</p>\n<p>Gate-model quantum computers use quantum logic gates to perform operations on qubits, similar to how classical computers use logic gates to perform operations with digital bits. The gate model is more suitable for general-purpose computing, while annealing quantum computing is more narrowly focused on optimization problems, such as workforce scheduling and portfolio optimization.</p>\n<p>D-Wave has been using annealing quantum technology in a hybrid solution to solve complex optimization problems. For example, it was able to optimize the mobile network resources of Japan’s largest telecom provider, NTT Docomo, in 40 seconds, compared to 27 hours using classical methods.</p>\n<p>Forrester’s report predicted that gate-based quantum computing platforms will likely remain experimental for 10 to 15 years, a prediction that Lanting agrees with. “However, annealing quantum computing — which is uniquely suited for solving complex optimization problems — is here now,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Optimization problems are everywhere — from workforce scheduling to vehicle routing — and D-Wave’s annealing quantum computers are already delivering measurable results for customers,” he said.</p>\n<p>Lanting maintained that D-Wave’s technology helped Pattison Food Group, a Canadian grocery chain, reduce an 80-hour scheduling task to just 15 hours — an 80% time savings — and at the Port of Los Angeles, working with SavantX, cargo handling efficiency was improved by 60%.</p>\n<p>“These aren’t theoretical use cases,” he said. “They’re real businesses solving real problems right now with quantum and hybrid quantum computing.”</p>\n<h3>Optimization Apps Will Lead Way</h3>\n<p>While D-Wave’s annealing platform has been touted by the company for years as superior to gate-based solutions for optimization problems, Forrester pointed out that those claims were challenged in 2024.</p>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://q-ctrl.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Q-CTRL</a> has challenged D-Wave’s claim by using IBM’s gate-based quantum computers to outperform D-Wave for an optimization problem,” the analysts wrote. “Gate-based algorithms offer the potential for greater solution speedups as qubit counts and quality increase.”</p>\n<p>“This makes Q-CTRL’s claim an interesting challenge to D-Wave’s self-proclaimed lead in optimization,” they continued.</p>\n<p>Optimization is an important application for quantum computing because it matters to most industries, Forrester noted. “For finance, representative areas include risk modeling, trading strategy optimization, asset pricing optimization, and portfolio optimization,” it explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Health care use cases include optimizing radiotherapy treatments, generating targeted cancer drug therapies, and creating protein models,” it added. “And for energy, use cases include energy exploration, seismic survey optimization, reserve and spot trading optimization, and reservoir optimization.”</p>\n<p>In the near term, if quantum is going to go beyond experimentation and generate a return on investment for users, it’s going to be through optimization tools, explained Erik Garcell, director of quantum enterprise development for North America for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.classiq.io\">Classiq</a>, a global quantum computer software maker.</p>\n<p>“Optimization offers more near-term benefits because it scales so well on quantum computers,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Even having a few quantum resources, you know, 100 qubits on your quantum chip, means a lot for that kind of problem.”</p>\n<p>“The bigger the problem, the harder it is for a classical computer to solve,” he continued, “but that many more resources aren’t needed for a quantum computer because of how it scales. So, you’re going to actually see applications in quantum for very large optimization problems that are causing classical computers to chug.”</p>\n<h3>Quantum Machine Learning Shows Signs of Life</h3>\n<p>Grimes, though, contends focusing on optimization can be too limiting for quantum. “Optimization completely rules out the chances of brand-new advancements,” he said. “I’m not sure if quantum is like the AI world, but it is getting the same sort of feel.”</p>\n<p>“It really feels like we are possibly on the cusp of tremendous, sudden improvement,” he continued. “There are so many organizations making steady improvement. It seems strange to me to think that not one of those vendors out of the thousands wouldn’t make a substantial breakthrough.”</p>\n<p>Another 2024 quantum breakthrough cited by the Forrester analysts is the emergence of quantum machine learning. They explained that quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) has expanded access to quantum computing, enabling breakthroughs in quantum machine learning. Researchers are now developing quantum neural networks, quantum support vector machines, and quantum algorithms for complex tasks like image and natural language processing.</p>\n<p>“These advancements are pushing the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve, making it a critical area of growth,” they wrote.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Training AI models on classical computers is time-intensive and computationally expensive, especially with deep learning networks, observed Skip Sanzeri, co-founder and COO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.qusecure.com\">QuSecure</a>, a maker of quantum-safe security solutions, in San Mateo, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Using an algorithm like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, along with other quantum enhancements like gradient descent, could speed up the training of machine learning models by orders of magnitude,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Sanzeri also pointed out that AI on classical systems is not exponentially scalable, so classical machines tend to struggle with combinatorial problems like optimization. “Since quantum computers are exponential in nature, they will be able to handle these combinatorial problems much better,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Quantum algorithms can also be used to process and analyze large data sets more efficiently using the Quantum Fourier Transform, leading to faster insights and real-time decision-making, he noted.</p>\n<p>Generative AI models, too, can be challenging for classical computing systems, he added. “Superposition and entanglement — quantum properties — can be used to generate data distributions more efficiently and accurately,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Preparation for Quantum Threats Becoming Urgent</h3>\n<p>As quantum advances push the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve, they’re also driving a focus on quantum security. “With NIST [the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology] setting standards for quantum-resistant algorithms, the need to safeguard data against future quantum threats is becoming more urgent,” the Forrester analysts wrote.</p>\n<p>They added that cryptography and machine learning hold substantial potential, but their benefits remain years away. Shor’s algorithm could one day break today’s PKI cryptography, they noted, although this is likely a decade or more in the future.</p>\n<p>Sanzeri disagreed with Forrester. “With the use of ever increasingly powerful AI, combined with other breakthroughs in the quantum computing industry — like <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/googles-willow-chip-has-quantum-developers-weeping-with-joy-179499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google’s Willow chip</a> — we could see that 10-year time frame getting cut in half,” he argued.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Grimes cautioned that government intelligence agencies working to break quantum-susceptible encryption don’t need a fully-capable quantum computer to break today’s cryptography. “They will make quantum devices that are specialized in breaking encryption, just like they do with today’s regular non-quantum encryption breaking,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The NSA isn’t using laptops, servers, and regular cloud computing to break crypto,” he continued. “They use specialized crypto-devices, maximized for crypto-breaking efficiency. Certainly, they are doing the exact same thing with quantum cracking. It would be insane to do anything else if I was in their shoes.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>He also warned about using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shor’s algorithm</a>, created in 1994, as a benchmark for what kind of quantum power is needed to crack PKI cryptography. “I think there is a good chance that the U.S. government has access to another algorithm that is far more efficient than Shor’s,” he contended. “If you’re fixated on Shor as the standard to meet, you’re probably not focused on the right algorithm.”</p>\n<p>Even if a quantum solution that can crack PKI is 10 years away, the time to act on that possibility is now, declared Tomas Gustavsson, chief PKI officer at <a href=\"https://www.keyfactor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyfactor</a>, a digital identity management company, in Cleveland. “A decade is a short time for this type of migration, as it is an immense undertaking,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“We need to act now for the migration to be completed in a decade. Organizations must not start in a decade,” Gustavsson said. “So, when saying that a practical Shor’s algorithm is at least a decade away, Forrester is reiterating what NIST and others are saying. I also hope it’s at least a decade away. If not, we are in trouble.”</p>\n<h3>Winter of Quantum Investor Discontent?</h3>\n<p>Despite quantum’s promise, Forrester predicts a “winter” setting in on investment in the technology. “Although the number of quantum computing deals hit a record in 2023, investment dollar totals peaked in 2021 and have declined sharply since as generative AI excitement has claimed investor funding,” Forrester’s analysts wrote.</p>\n<p>They added that geopolitical pressures, like vendors in China transferring their IP to academia, are also at play. “This will put pressure on startups, causing many to seek exits with little to show,” they noted.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, the investment winter will delay the time when quantum computing platforms become powerful enough for mainstream use, which means a delay of Y2Q: the day when quantum computers break state-of-the-art asymmetric cryptography, the analysts reasoned.</p>\n<p>However, they warned about procrastinating about Y2Q. Although this development may buy more time to implement post-quantum encryption, they urged security leaders to begin planning now on how to protect against “harvest now, decrypt later” vulnerabilities, where encrypted data is gobbled up by adversaries now with an eye on decrypting it later with a quantum computer.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Forrester’s glum weather forecast isn’t shared by everyone. Growth estimates for the quantum computing market by industry forecasters range from a low CAGR of 27.04% over the next eight years to a high CAGR of 32.7% over the next five years, growing from slightly over a billion dollar market in 2024 to US$6.95 billion to $16.22 billion market in the early 2030s.</p>\n<p>“We would not expect a quantum winter but may see the same level of investment or increased investment in 2025,” Sanzeri predicted. “There has been significant progress in quantum computing in 2024 with some breakthroughs that are fundamental. We cannot find a reason why there would be at least the same level of investment in 2025 as in 2024.”</p>\n<p>“The recent relative downturn in quantum investment is really just a factor of the original, overstated quantum hype dying down at the same time as AI took off,” added Grimes. “Quantum will have plenty of investment, and as the steady improvements turn into sufficiently-capable quantum computers, the needed investment will flood back. I’m not concerned.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Since Microsoft launched Copilot+, the past few months have been a battleground for PC manufacturers. Qualcomm initially had a huge lead, but then AMD and Intel came out with Copilot+ PCs that cut into that advantage.</p>\n<p>AMD outperformed Intel with a broader line of compliant products, while Intel focused on the premium market. Meanwhile, Qualcomm saw its design wins decline, and the laptop PC market has shifted more in AMD’s favor, though Intel remains the dominant player overall.</p>\n<p>Why didn’t we see the big shift to Qualcomm, and what happened to Intel that cost its CEO?</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down — and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, which has been keeping my driveway clear for the last week or so.</p>\n<h3>Why Copilot+ PCs Struggled To Gain Traction</h3>\n<p>Microsoft rushed to market with Copilot+ for PCs with two primary features. One was Cocreator, a derivative of Dall-E, which could have been pretty handy (I use Dall-E a lot these days). The other was Recall, an automatic indexing tool designed to help users find hard-to-locate files. That was pretty much it at launch.</p>\n<p>However, Microsoft positioned Recall poorly and had to pull it back. Cocreator by itself on a laptop — as opposed to a desktop PC or workstation where folks usually mess with graphics — turned out to be not very interesting.</p>\n<p>So, for a time, Qualcomm had only Copilot+ PCs. People weren’t too excited about Copilot+, and by the time Office began showcasing AI capabilities, PCs from AMD and Intel were available to run it. Unfortunately, Qualcomm’s brand name wasn’t as well known in PCs as AMD or Intel. In addition, Qualcomm’s product had a compatibility problem that made it largely unacceptable in large companies, so enterprise and large business sales never really emerged outside of trials.</p>\n<p>A heavy marketing campaign was needed to sell people on the features of running Copilot+ locally. That never emerged, so AI PCs became an AMD and Intel project, with Qualcomm increasingly on the sidelines.</p>\n<h3>What Qualcomm Should Have Done</h3>\n<p>Qualcomm had three advantages in the market: great battery life, the strongest wireless networking of any of the three vendors, and dominance in premium smartphones, which are basically pocket PCs.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm pushed hard on the AI aspect, which Microsoft fumbled badly. It did mention battery life, but it wasn’t successful in making its PCs 5G-capable, which removed that advantage. Finally, it didn’t have a “better together” story to leverage its strong smartphone advantage.</p>\n<p>Taking on entrenched vendors like AMD and Intel is very difficult, but Qualcomm almost acted like it wasn’t that important, even though it acted seriously about this market. In addition, because it had a compatibility problem, it needed to do targeted marketing for the low-hanging fruit: users who wouldn’t experience this shortcoming, influencers, small business owners, consultants, attorneys, and others who don’t run a lot of custom apps or need to play PC games on their laptops.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>However, Qualcomm didn’t target these users. As a result, while compatibility improved, people tended to lose interest in Qualcomm’s offer over time.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm could also have created a halo product that showcased its strengths. The <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/laptops/business/elite-folio.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP Folio PC</a> was an ideal configuration for much of the audience Qualcomm needed to capture, and it launched with an older Snapdragon processor and a 5G modem, making it nearly perfect.</p>\n<p>Intel displaced Qualcomm with an inferior product (for this use case), and eventually, HP discontinued the Qualcomm-powered PC. Losing the Folio was disappointing because it was my favorite PC of all time. It showcased that with the right internals and effective marketing, a Qualcomm-based PC could have gained traction with users who valued its unique advantages.</p>\n<p>If both HP and Qualcomm had put some decent marketing behind this laptop, it would have helped build interest in Qualcomm’s solution, and it would be in a vastly stronger position than it is now.</p>\n<h3>Intel’s Challenges and Leadership Shake-Up</h3>\n<p>Intel and Microsoft don’t see eye to eye often, which has been problematic for both companies’ execution over the years. Intel seemed to take Microsoft’s requests as bad suggestions, which forced Microsoft to work with Qualcomm rather than Intel. AMD’s reputation was more on the high-performance side, and while AMD executed well, it didn’t have anything ready at launch. That gave Qualcomm the huge initial advantage that it failed to capitalize on.</p>\n<p>This failure appeared to be connected to a prior CEO’s decision to reduce the focus on PC technology in favor of smartphones, an effort that failed spectacularly due to poor execution and some questionable behavior by Apple that left Intel out of step with both AMD and Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>Most recently, Intel lost its CEO partially due to a change in U.S. leadership where the proximity of the Intel CEO to the prior administration might have created some excessive friction and the anticipated loss of U.S. funding for its fab and foundry business.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This situation again highlights the market’s resistance to significant strategic moves that come at the expense of short-term performance — a disappointing reality, given the strategic importance of U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Now Intel has co-CEOs, which is stronger tactically but makes it harder to execute strategically. In addition, Intel’s CMO support was below where it needed to be, and Intel’s CTO was more of a COO, leaving the critical CTO underperforming. The CTO sets the vision for strategic moves. Without that, the short-term problems likely contributed significantly to CEO Pat Gelsinger’s premature departure.</p>\n<p>Intel needs to appoint a real CTO. There’s a new CMO, but Intel needs to both support and fund him to reform Intel’s image as a market leader.</p>\n<h3>How AMD Outperformed Intel and Qualcomm</h3>\n<p>AMD’s people just put their heads down and executed, and of the three vendors, it ended up doing the best, even suggesting it would <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/amd-is-making-great-strides-in-ai-may-end-up-merging-with-intel-179449.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buy Intel</a>. Qualcomm was on the list of companies looking to buy Intel, too. However, Intel is both more complex and far larger than either AMD or Qualcomm, making it unlikely that either company would be comfortable making this acquisition.</p>\n<p>AMD would be the strongest of the two because it shares both market coverage and x86 technology, meaning it would be better able to step in seamlessly to lead Intel. Still, given how complex Intel is and the cloud it’s under, it seems unlikely either firm will be able to make an Intel acquisition happen.</p>\n<p>So, as AI hit, while Qualcomm had the initial potential benefit, AMD has seen the greatest benefit, primarily because it just outexecuted the other two companies.</p>\n<p>There is something to be said about focus. AMD showed an incredible level of focus over the last decade, which helped it achieve significant growth and benefit from the latest trends. Its recent <a href=\"https://ir.amd.com/financial-information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial results</a> were impressive.</p>\n<p>AMD could have displaced Intel during this cycle, but that would have required substantial additional investments. As I noted above, the market isn’t rewarding strategies that pull from the present to create a stronger future. AMD played the market well in this cycle.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Nvidia’s AI Supremacy and Future in PCs</h3>\n<p>It has been an interesting few months since Microsoft launched Copilot+. Execution was key, and AMD outperformed Qualcomm and Intel by just sticking to what it’s good at. However, Nvidia remains the king of AI in hardware, and it also has an Arm-based processor coming, which means it could disrupt the market as AI matures.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> Thanks to Nvidia’s AI leadership, it’s already in a better position to steal market share than Qualcomm was. DeepSeek, which mainly uses older Nvidia technology, has shown a path forward that could favor Nvidia in future hardware if it decides to expand. Unlike Qualcomm, Nvidia is more likely to target both desktop and mobile PC markets. Notably, desktop PCs were overlooked in the Copilot+ rollout despite being the preferred platform for tools like Cocreator, which are commonly used for graphics development.</p>\n<p>However, we are still at the very front of the AI wave. By the end of it, I expect both smartphones and PCs will have been replaced by hardware that better addresses the need to interact with AIs in a way we never did with PCs. A massive disruption is coming, and only Nvidia appears truly positioned to drive it. Well, and Huawei, but we’ll save that for another column.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Yarbo AI-Powered Snowblower Robot</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-robotic-snowblower.jpg\" alt=\"Yarbo AI-Powered Robotic Snowblower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-robotic-snowblower.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-robotic-snowblower-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-robotic-snowblower-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Yarbo</p>\n<p>While I got my first <a href=\"https://www.yarbo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yarbo</a> over a year ago, I never put it together because I’d broken my back and couldn’t mess with something that heavy.

Mine is a blower only, but it also comes with a trailer hitch and a security head unit if I want it to patrol my yard after the snow melts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-Family-of-Products.jpg\" alt=\"Yarbo family of outdoor robots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-Family-of-Products.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-Family-of-Products-300x93.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-Family-of-Products-768x238.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Some of the Yarbo yard robots and accessories (Image Credit: Yarbo)</p>\n<p>Yarbo has sold over 5,000 units to date, making it one of the most successful robots for the outdoors, if not the most successful, this last year. This is an AI/GPS robot, so you don’t have to trench and put in boundary wires, like many of the early robotic lawnmowers. It charges inductively, which means you can run and charge it even if you aren’t home.</p>\n<p>It does need to see the GPS satellites, which can make placement of the base station difficult (the base station communicates with the Yarbo). My initial base station placement attached to the house didn’t work, so I had to move it to one of my sheds. It works fine now, though I’m not a fan of having to run an extension cord over my driveway.</p>\n<p>I noticed that the Yarbo really doesn’t like uneven pavers. Neither does my Honda snowblower, but at least I can rock it back to go over the problem areas. You have to set the Yarbo so the blower is a bit higher, which means it isn’t going down to the road. I hope a future software patch will address this.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-in-action.jpg\" alt=\"Yarbo AI-powered robotic snowblower clearing snow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-in-action.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-in-action-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Yarbo-in-action-768x353.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Yarbo snowblower at work (Photos by Author)</p>\n<p>In addition, it comes with winter treads with built-in studs that can tear up an epoxy garage floor like mine, but it has been working okay with the summer treads so far. Running it out of your garage is somewhat problematic anyway since it requires a line of sight to the GPS satellites.</p>\n<p>It comes with what looks like an Xbox controller that you can use to drive the Yarbo manually and map out the area you want it to service. It also uses a smartphone app. Yarbo does a good job of detecting people and animals, and it will stop if either approaches it. It also has an emergency off switch.</p>\n<p>I have a large, long driveway, around 3,000 sq. ft. The Yarbo takes about an hour and a half (using half its battery charge) to complete that job. You can tell it where to put the snow, and it will craft a far better plan than I have ever made to clear it all.</p>\n<p>Although the Yarbo isn’t a cheap date, it allows me not to get up early to clear snow in the morning, and it runs autonomously unless it gets into trouble (those damned pavers). I’ve really enjoyed setting it up and using it. As a result, Yarbo is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I’m old, which means I get to see the same mistakes made by the same companies over and over again.</p>\n<p>I’d hoped that AI would fix this, but that clearly isn’t the case at the moment because Google has once again previewed a product before it was ready and is getting some bad initial reviews.</p>\n<p>Remember Google Glass? That product was released before it was ready, and due to the bad press it received, head-mounted displays were delayed for around a decade.</p>\n<p>Well, Google has started previewing Gemini for Android Auto before it is ready, and users aren’t becoming fans. This week, let’s talk about why Gemini for your car could be a good thing if Google doesn’t kill it prematurely.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week: a really cool, smart, vehicle-mounted drone system that will be available across all BYD models.</p>\n<h3>Premature Product Launches and Marketing Failures</h3>\n<p>One of the advantages of having a strong marketing organization is that it can manage bad initial impressions and help prevent an unfinished product from ruining its future potential.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs was a master at this. While he was alive, Apple out-marketed almost every other company on the planet. The result was that Apple was able to bring to market an iPhone that initially sucked but survived until it didn’t. Then, it transformed the market.</p>\n<p>Google isn’t a marketing company. We saw this in spades with Google Glass, another product released before it was ready, which then died a painful death. It’s hard to overcome bad first impressions; products introduced before they are ready generally leave bad first impressions.</p>\n<p>We can see this with the initial coverage for Gemini in Android Auto. While I don’t think the product is cooked yet, I also don’t think it is as bad as the reviewers seem to think it is, and I believe it will get a ton better.</p>\n<h3>AI’s Role in Modern Vehicles</h3>\n<p>I recall back in the 1970s when car makers decided buyers wanted a voice rather than an idiot light to tell them what was going on. You’d get verbal scripted messages like “your door is ajar” or “fasten your seatbelts.” That got really annoying after a short time and killed this feature.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking to your car wasn’t bad, but having it verbally alert you to what a light indicator would have done faster, better, and cheaper didn’t seem like a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>However, AI in your car could be far more interesting because you can converse with AIs. Rather than the pain of voice commands that came after scripted voice alerts (with voice commands, you have to learn specific commands), AIs like Gemini use natural language and can converse with you.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>AI can do many things, like identifying a place along your route with food you’d enjoy, alerting you that you are getting sleepy, and automatically taking you to a safe, affordable hotel. It could provide deeper analytics than idiot lights do.</p>\n<p>For instance, the meaning of a check engine light can indicate anything from a minor issue to a critical failure, depending on the affected system. So rather than a general alert, the AI could point to the component that had failed, tell you the criticality of the failure, and then get you the appropriate help, whether that’s a tow truck or factory support.</p>\n<p>The criticality of the failure would be a huge benefit. If interference engines have a problem with the timing chain, they can self-destruct if the engine isn’t turned off immediately, and a coolant leak can result in a blown head gasket and the need for a new engine. Having AI prevent any of that would be well worth the cost of admission.</p>\n<h3>AI as a Co-Pilot for Drivers</h3>\n<p>I used to drive long distances solo a lot when I was younger. Staying awake on a long drive, particularly at night when there is little or no traffic, is problematic. Having someone to talk to helps, but a passenger can fall asleep, too, which isn’t always ideal on a long drive.</p>\n<p>Gemini is a conversational AI, which means you should be able to talk to it and have it hold a conversation with you.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Exploring new ideas, chatting about things around you that you might otherwise miss, or just discussing a subject that interests you could make the drive go by faster and make it less likely you’ll wake up in a hospital or worse.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this conversational feature could be particularly useful for long-haul truck drivers.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Will Gemini in Android Auto Succeed?</h3>\n<p>Assuming it was well-trained, generative AI in a vehicle would be a great addition. It should provide more complete answers to questions, more effectively guide you to gas, food, or safety, tell you not only what is wrong with your car but what you should do to limit the damage, and keep you entertained on long trips where you are very likely to fall asleep.</p>\n<p>But the AI has to be properly trained, performant, and not annoying. Right now, Gemini in Android Auto is none of those things. Thus, it shouldn’t be seen in the light of day because it is creating negative impressions that could eventually kill this effort.</p>\n<p>I hate to see Android Auto AI go the way of Google Glass, but it doesn’t look like Google has yet learned from past mistakes. Let’s hope Google corrects its path, as I’d really like a working AI to chat with while I drive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>BYD DJI Car Drone Feature</h3>\n<p>The Chinese are doing some amazing things with their EVs. They have EVs that can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ofpJXoqnHs8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">become boats</a> should you need to get out of a flood, EVs that can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkROmU9Bxbw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rotate on their axis</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECgVLceb_LE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flying cars</a> that look like they are decent cars. They even have a car that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIKAn8yDkpA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">jumps over obstacles</a> on the road. Audi’s new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZbbboAaPuOw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E-Tron GT Performance</a> does this as well, and I have to admit I lust for that car.</p>\n<p>But what caught my eye, particularly as I think about how AI could be used in driving, was the BYD/DJI (DJI is the biggest Chinese drone company) and their effort to wed a drone with their SUV line.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BYD &amp; DJI Just Changed the Game – Car Mounted Drones Are Here!\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YQrAgJw_Cs\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Part of why I find this fascinating and want one is that I was a fan of the old Green Hornet TV show in the 1960s, and Black Beauty, Green Hornet’s car, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-TauF6XpA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had something like this</a>. Audi has <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Hj4cZL51xw?t=50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something similar</a>, which is an amazing prototype.</p>\n<p>BYD is bringing it to market, and while I like the Audi concept better, there is an advantage to having something you can actually sell.</p>\n<p>However, in the Audi video linked above, you can see how a drone, or in the case of the Audi, drones, could be used to guide the way on dark roads, look ahead to see what the nature of a massive traffic jam is, or, in the case of a space alien invasion, realize in time that you need to be driving in the opposite direction fast (I watch too many sci-fi movies).</p>\n<p>I can picture driving to a picturesque area and then launching the drone to get a unique picture, using it to capture all aspects of an accident, sending it ahead to an area that looks dicey to make sure you can make it through (like if there is a flash flood warning), or looking for help if you are broken down and can’t get a cell signal.</p>\n<p>And of course, pulling into a cars and coffee event and then launching the drone from your roof. It would surely draw attention from the one or two overpriced supercars that always seem to get the most attention. Not that I’m into that at all…</p>\n<p>I just think this BYD/DJI effort would be really cool. I only wish we could buy BYD cars here in the U.S. so I could check it out. So, this drone option is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The past year saw artificial intelligence (AI) push the boundaries of what’s possible, with industries racing to integrate its capabilities to boost productivity and automate complex tasks.</p>\n<p>In 2024, AI advancements accelerated at a pace outstripping previous high-tech innovations, setting the stage for even greater disruption ahead. But with this rapid progress comes a risk: without human oversight, AI’s missteps could be just as monumental as its breakthroughs.</p>\n<p>Generative and agentic AI are already enhancing users’ ability to obtain sophisticated content across various media, while AI-powered health care tools are reshaping diagnostics — outperforming human physicians in certain tasks. These developments signal a looming transformation in health care delivery, with AI poised to play an even bigger role in business and industrial operations.</p>\n<p>The power of AI will also birth humanoid agents, noted Anders Indset, author and deep-tech investor in exponential technologies such as AI, quantum technology, health tech, and cybersecurity. As we step into 2025, the technology landscape is rapidly evolving, with a spotlight on humanoid agents.</p>\n<p>“This year began with excitement surrounding large language models (LLMs) but is set to end with groundbreaking advancements in autonomous humanoid robots,” Indset told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>In 2024, the development of robots surged, with innovations that once seemed far off now coming into view. The long-anticipated release of fully autonomous humanoids — previously confined to industrial settings — is approaching, he observed.</p>\n<p>The arrival of 2025 brings anticipation for the widespread adoption of AI in robotics, enhanced human-robot interactions, and the rise of robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) models. These will make advanced robotic solutions accessible to more industries, Indset explained, describing the ensuing transformative period for the robotics industry.</p>\n<p>“Humanoid agents will reshape our interactions with technology and expand the possibilities for AI applications across different domains,” he predicted.</p>\n<h3>AI’s Expanding Role in Cybersecurity and Biosecurity</h3>\n<p>AI will play an increasingly critical role in cyberwarfare, warned Alejandro Rivas-Vasquez, global head of digital forensics and incident response at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/\">NCC Group</a>. AI and machine learning (ML) will make cyberwarfare more deadly, with collateral damage outside of conflict zones due to hyper-connectivity, he offered.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity defenses, already a successful tool for digital warriors, will extend beyond protecting digital systems to safeguarding people directly through implantable technology. Neural interfaces, bio-augmentation, authentication chips, and advanced medical implants will revolutionize human interaction with technology.</p>\n<p>According to Bobbie Walker, managing consultant at NCC Group, these innovations will also introduce significant risks.</p>\n<p>“Hackers could exploit neural interfaces to control actions or manipulate perceptions, leading to cognitive manipulation and breaches of personal autonomy. Continuous monitoring of health and behavioral data through implants raises substantial privacy concerns, with risks of misuse by malicious actors or invasive government surveillance,” Walker told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>To mitigate these risks, new frameworks bridging technology, health care, and privacy regulations will be essential. Walker cautioned that standards for “digital bioethics” and ISO standards for bio-cybersecurity will help define safe practices for integrating technology into the human body while addressing ethical dilemmas.</p>\n<p>“The emerging field of cyber-biosecurity will push us to rethink cybersecurity boundaries, ensuring that technology integrated into our bodies is secure, ethical, and protective of the individuals using it,” she added.</p>\n<p>According to Walker, early studies on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show that adversarial inputs can trick these devices, highlighting the potential for abuse. As implants evolve, the risks of state-sponsored cyberwarfare and privacy breaches grow, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and ethical considerations.</p>\n<h3>AI-Driven Data Backup Raises Security Concerns</h3>\n<p>Sebastian Straub, principal solution architect at <a href=\"https://n2ws.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N2WS</a>, stated that AI advancements better equip organizations to resume operations after natural disasters, power outages, and cyberattacks. AI automation will enhance operational efficiency by addressing human shortcomings.</p>\n<p>AI-powered backup automation will reduce the need for administrative intervention to near zero, he explained. AI will learn the intricate patterns of data usage, compliance requirements, and organizational needs. Moreover, AI will become a proactive data management expert, autonomously determining what needs to be backed up and when, including adherence to compliance standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.</p>\n<p>But Straub warned that as this level of AI dominance dramatically transforms disaster recovery processes, errors will occur through the learning process. In 2025, we will see that AI is not a silver bullet. Relying on machines to automate disaster recovery will lead to mistakes.</p>\n<p>“There will be unfortunate breaches of trust and compliance violations as enterprises learn the hard way that humans need to be part of the DR decision-making process,” Straub told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>AI’s Impact on Creativity and Education</h3>\n<p>For many AI users, tools to help improve communication skills are already in steady use. ChatGPT and other AI writing tools will emphasize the value of human writing rather than a workaround for personal language tasks.</p>\n<p>Students and communicators will adjust from asking AI writing tools to produce work on their behalf to owning the content creation process from start to finish. They will leverage technology to edit, enhance, or expand original thinking, suggested Eric Wang, VP of AI at plagiarism detection firm <a href=\"https://www.turnitin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turnitin</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Wang told TechNewsWorld that writing would be recognized as a critical skill, not just in writing-focused areas of study but also in learning, working, and living environments. This change will manifest as the humanization of technology-enabled fields, roles, and companies.</p>\n<p>He sees the role of generative AI shifting, with early-stage usage helping to organize and expand ideas while later stages refine and enhance writing. For educators, AI can identify knowledge gaps early on and later provide transparency to facilitate student engagement.</p>\n<h3>Hidden Risks of AI-Powered Models</h3>\n<p>According to Michael Lieberman, CTO and co-founder of software development security platform <a href=\"https://www.kusari.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kusari</a>, AI will become more widespread and challenging to detect. His concern lies with free models hosted on platforms.</p>\n<p>“We have already seen cases where some models on these platforms were discovered to be malware. I expect such attacks to increase, though they will likely be more covert. These malicious models may include hidden backdoors or be intentionally trained to behave harmfully in specific scenarios,” Lieberman told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He sees an increasing prevalence of data poisoning attacks aimed at manipulating LLMs and warns that most organizations do not train their own models.</p>\n<p>“Instead, they rely on pre-trained models, often available for free. The lack of transparency regarding the origins of these models makes it easy for malicious actors to introduce harmful ones,” he continued, citing the Hugging Face malware incident as an example.</p>\n<p>Future data poisoning efforts are likely to target major players like OpenAI, Meta, and Google, whose vast datasets make such attacks more challenging to detect.</p>\n<p>“In 2025, attackers are likely to outpace defenders. Attackers are financially motivated, while defenders often struggle to secure adequate budgets since security is not typically viewed as a revenue driver. It may take a significant AI supply chain breach — akin to the SolarWinds Sunburst incident — to prompt the industry to take the threat seriously,” Turnitin’s Wang concluded.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Linux desktop developers may see an increase in adoption in 2025 despite the lack of commercial marketing strategies hawking the benefits of running Linux on consumer computers.</p>\n<p>The arrival of the New Year brings a crucial decision for millions of computer users worldwide. In just 10 months, Microsoft will end support for Windows 10, leaving users with three options: upgrade to Windows 11 (if eligible), pay steep subscription fees for extended security support, or explore alternative computing solutions.</p>\n<p>Microsoft hopes many Windows 10 users will reluctantly purchase new, more powerful devices to meet Windows 11’s upgrade requirements. For those unwilling to do so, the search for alternatives begins.</p>\n<p>Switching to Linux offers both convenience and cost savings. Upgrading to Linux is free, and you can install it on your existing hardware to replace Windows.</p>\n<p>Options for stranded Windows 10 users include switching to costlier macOS-based devices or adopting Chromebooks with ChromeOS, a less expensive, cloud-focused ecosystem. Another proven alternative is letting Linux breathe new life into existing hardware with a free, customizable operating system.</p>\n<p>With the Windows 10 security updates and support deadline looming on Oct. 4, 2025, Linux developers see a potential for Windows users to switch, potentially marking 2025 as “The Year of the Linux Desktop.” According to a recent Forbes article, “nearly 900 million Windows 10 users are still holding out,” presenting a significant opportunity for Linux adoption.</p>\n<p>These potential Linux converts will be joined by existing Linux users exploring upgrade options to other distributions. Unlike Microsoft and Apple platforms, Linux is not a single operating system. Instead, it offers dozens of highly configurable distributions with unique features and desktop environments, providing users with unparalleled customization options.</p>\n<p>Its diverse ecosystem offers options tailored to various needs, giving users unparalleled flexibility to shape their computing experience. Special tools even let die-hard Windows fans run their favorite Microsoft applications inside the Linux desktop.</p>\n<h3>Exploring Linux Without Installing It</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite Linux discovery sites was DistroTest.net, which shut down several years ago. It was a novel way to sample dozens of Linux desktops and distros from a browser tab. I could select from some 300 Linux distros running on a virtual machine (VM) the site hosted without installing or configuring anything.</p>\n<p>Several websites offer similar capabilities using emulators. These sites run software programs that allow a computer system to mimic the functions of another system. These online tools simplify the journey of Windows 10 users hesitant to upgrade and Linux users eager to try something new. They offer ease of use when exploring the range of Linux distributions, from beginner-friendly options to advanced environments.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Setting up and using emulators locally on your computer is a drawback to adoption for inexperienced computer users. However, a few user-friendly options let you explore free, fully functional Linux operating systems without leaving your web browser in whatever other computer platform you use.</p>\n<p>Although these websites’ Linux inventories are less extensive, they let you sample Linux without installing it on your machine. This approach gives potential new users an easier way to test drive Linux distros in their web browsers without downloading and configuring files. All you need is an internet connection and a web browser.</p>\n<h3>Online Emulators To Help Find Linux Gems</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, no genuinely adequate replacement for DistroTest.net exists. Linux developers lack a commercial marketing mechanism to drive adoption, as no company owns the Linux OS. If developers offered an emulator tool on their websites, potential adopters could experience the Linux version more easily before downloading and installing it on their computers.</p>\n<h5>These four websites help fill the void of selecting and trying out various Linux offerings:</h5>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://distrosea.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DistroSea</a></strong> hosts more than 50 Linux distros, offering a beginner-friendly way to explore options.

      "content": "<p>Google announced a major step forward in the development of a commercial quantum computer on Tuesday, releasing test results for its Willow quantum chip.</p>\n<p>Those results show that the more qubits Google used in Willow, the more errors it reduced and the more quantum the system became.</p>\n<p>“Google’s achievement in quantum error correction is a significant milestone toward practical quantum computing,” said Florian Neukart, chief product officer at <a href=\"https://terraquantum.swiss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Terra Quantum</a>, a developer of quantum algorithms, computing solutions, and security applications, in Saint Gallen, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>“It addresses one of the largest hurdles — maintaining coherence and reducing errors during computation,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Qubits, the basic information unit in quantum computing, are extremely sensitive to their environment. Any disturbances around them can cause them to lose their quantum properties, which is called decoherence. Maintaining qubit stability — or coherence — long enough to perform useful computations has been a significant challenge for developers.</p>\n<p>Decoherence also makes quantum computers error-prone, which is why Google’s announcement is so important. Effective error correction is essential to the development of a practical quantum computer.</p>\n<p>“Willow marks an important milestone on the journey toward fault-tolerant quantum computing,” said Rebecca Krauthamer, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.qusecure.com\">QuSecure</a>, a maker of quantum-safe security solutions in San Mateo, Calif.</p>\n<p>“It’s a step closer to making quantum systems commercially viable,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Progress Toward Large-Scale Quantum Computing</h3>\n<p>In a company blog, Google Vice President of Engineering Hartmut Neven explained that researchers tested ever-larger arrays of physical qubits, scaling up from a grid of 3×3 encoded qubits, to a grid of 5×5, to a grid of 7×7. With each advance, they cut the error rate in half. “In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction in the error rate,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>“This historic accomplishment is known in the field as ‘below threshold’ — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“The machines are very sensitive, and noise builds up both from any external influence as well as from use itself,” said Simon Fried, vice president for business development and marketing at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.classiq.io\">Classiq</a>, a developer of software for quantum computers, in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Being able to minimize noise or compensate for it makes it possible to run longer, more complex programs,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“This is significant progress in terms of chip tech because of the inherent stability of the hardware as well as its ability to control noise,” he added.</p>\n<p>Neven also noted that as the first system below the threshold, this is the most convincing prototype for a scalable logical qubit built to date. “It’s a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built,” he wrote. “Willow brings us closer to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that can’t be replicated on conventional computers.”</p>\n<h3>Willow’s Implications for the Multiverse and Security</h3>\n<p>Google also released data on Willow’s performance based on a common quantum computer test known as the random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark. “[I]t checks whether a quantum computer is doing something that couldn’t be done on a classical computer,” Neven explained. “Any team building a quantum computer should check first if it can beat classical computers on RCS; otherwise, there is strong reason for skepticism that it can tackle more complex quantum tasks.”</p>\n<p>Neven called Willow’s performance on the RCS benchmark “astonishing.” It performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years — that’s 10 followed by 25 zeroes.</p>\n<p>“This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe,” he wrote. “It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Chris Hickman, chief security officer at <a href=\"https://www.keyfactor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyfactor</a>, a digital identity management company in Cleveland, hailed Willow as “a significant milestone in quantum computing” but cautioned that Willow’s advanced quantum error correction brings the field closer to practical quantum applications, signaling that businesses need to prioritize preparation for the inevitable disruption of quantum computing in areas like encryption and security.</p>\n<p>“While this development doesn’t immediately alter the expected timeline for quantum computers to break current encryption standards, it reinforces the idea that progress towards this milestone is accelerating,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Practical use cases for quantum computers go beyond applications that stand to benefit businesses,” he said. “Bad actors will inevitably leverage the technology for their own nefarious benefit.”</p>\n<p>“Hackers will leverage quantum computers to decrypt sensitive information, rendering legacy cryptographic methods obsolete,” he continued. “These include algorithms like <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rsa.com/\">RSA</a> and ECC, which are currently considered unbreakable.”</p>\n<h3>Beware the Quantum Cure-All</h3>\n<p>Karl Holmqvist, founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lastwall.com\">Lastwall</a>, a provider of identity-centric and quantum-resilient technologies, in Mountain View, Calif., agreed that the rate of development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers is accelerating. “But I also understand that there are skeptics who think development is not as close as it seems or that it may never arrive,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“So, my question to everyone is this: Given that we will either deploy quantum-resilient solutions too early or too late, which scenario carries more risk?” he asked. “Would you rather understand the implications of post-quantum cryptographic deployments, test them in your environments, and be prepared to rapidly deploy when needed — or risk losing your secrets?”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>In his blog, Neven also revealed why he changed his focus from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. “My answer is that both will prove to be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced AI will significantly benefit from access to quantum computing,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Quantum computing is inherently designed to tackle complex problems, so it could be very helpful with the development of AI, noted Edward Tian, CEO of <a href=\"https://gptzero.me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GPTZero</a>, maker of an AI detection platform in Arlington, Va. “However, we have seen instances of classical AI still being the better method,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“I came out of AI and entered the quantum computing world specifically because of the promise quantum computing has to unlock doors that remain shut in a classical computing world,” added QuSecure’s Krauthamer.</p>\n<p>However, she had a word of caution about the technology. “A quantum computer is not simply a bigger, faster, more powerful computer,” she said. “It thinks in a fundamentally different way and, therefore, will solve different types of problems than we can today. It is wise to be skeptical if quantum computing is presented as a cure-all for challenging computation tasks.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>As a lifelong New York Giants fan, it’s been hard to suffer through the 2024 season, culminating last weekend in the Giants’ most recent debacle, losing to the below-average New Orleans Saints on a botched field goal in the last seconds of the game.</p>\n<p>In my disgust in the aftermath of the game, it occurred to me: Is present-day Intel the equivalent of the 2024 Giants? It sounds like a ridiculous question, but the similarities are eerie.</p>\n<p>Let’s face it: The two titans of their industries — the New York Giants in professional football and Intel in technology — have struggled through severe scrutiny and poor performance the past few years. Both were once at the top of their fields, making headlines and defining periods, so it’s easy to draw analogies between them.</p>\n<p>For the Giants, simply beyond the sheer shoddiness of the on-field performance over the past few years (the team hasn’t been to the Super Bowl since 2012), management made one of the most idiotic decisions of all time before the season began by extending a questionable long-term contract to “franchise” quarterback Daniel Jones and allowing Saquon Barkley to sign with its divisional rival, the Philadelphia Eagles. Now, Barkley is having one of the greatest seasons of all time for a running back.</p>\n<p>As for Intel, the company has struggled to maintain market share in the PC space over the past few years, conceded the smartphone space after it passed over Apple’s request for a suitable silicon solution for its iPhone in 2007 (which would have ecosystem ramifications that Apple has taken advantage of), not to mention missing the overall industry movement to Arm-based architectures for mobile devices and even laptops.</p>\n<p>Both organizations are currently under fire for their (at least perceived) inability to give fans and customers a modicum of faith that turnarounds were in the making. Although there are similarities between their difficulties, a deeper examination shows that Intel’s problems are essentially distinct from the New York Giants’ of 2024 and are being addressed in a way that distinguishes the company from them.</p>\n<h3>Giant Issues</h3>\n<p>The New York Giants, a legendary NFL team that has won four Super Bowls, was under tremendous pressure going into the 2024 campaign.</p>\n<p>Recent years have been characterized by inconsistent play, dubious coaching choices, and poor player development. In today’s NFL, the team has had difficulty adjusting when creative play-calling and analytics-driven tactics are paramount.</p>\n<p>The Giants have mostly failed to take advantage of their chances despite brief flashes of potential, which has created discouraged supporters and experts doubtful of their prospects, as well as exasperating season ticket holders like me.</p>\n<h3>Difficulties Facing Intel</h3>\n<p>Intel used to be the undisputed leader in its industry. The company literally controlled the semiconductor market for many years, establishing the chip innovation and performance benchmark. But a slew of upheavals in the 2020s put its hegemony in jeopardy. The emergence of rivals like AMD and Nvidia and the advanced manufacturing technology pioneered by Taiwan Semiconductor have compelled Intel to confront its weaknesses.</p>\n<p>The leading cause of Intel’s problems is the company’s delay in switching to sophisticated manufacturing nodes. Due to setbacks with its 10nm and 7nm nodes, Intel lost market share in essential categories, while Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung advanced with their state-of-the-art 5nm and 3nm processes. These challenges were exacerbated by the increasing use of Arm-based architectures, especially in AI and mobile applications, where Intel’s x86 architecture has struggled to stay competitive.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Although the Giants and Intel face formidable obstacles, their responses distinguish them. The Giants have frequently seemed hapless, switching quarterbacks and coaches in an attempt to find a short-term solution. Due to their inability to develop a clear plan of action, fans and experts are beginning to doubt the franchise’s long-term survival.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Intel has attempted to take serious action to overcome its obstacles. Under the direction of CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company launched a daring plan to regain its place at the forefront of the semiconductor industry.</p>\n<p>The core of this endeavor is Intel’s IDM 2.0 strategy, which aims to increase its role as a foundry for third-party clients while modernizing its manufacturing capabilities. By doing this, Intel hopes to take on Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung head-to-head as a manufacturing giant and chip designer.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Intel has increased its focus on cutting-edge technologies. Its attempts to create specialized chips for data centers and its investments in AI-specific hardware, such as the Gaudi AI accelerators, demonstrate a proactive approach to the upcoming wave of computing innovation. In fairness to Intel, these actions have revealed a business willing to own up to its mistakes while working to influence the future rather than merely responding to it.</p>\n<h3>Changes in Culture and Leadership</h3>\n<p>An organization’s ability to overcome hardships is largely dependent on its leadership. With numerous coaching staff changes and a front office that frequently appears out of step with the team’s demands, the Giants have had difficulty establishing a permanent leadership structure. This unpredictability has led to a lack of direction and identity on the field. Watch any of the Giants’ losses over the past few seasons, and it’s hard to dispute this.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Intel enjoyed reasonable unity and support when Pat Gelsinger rejoined the company. Gelsinger prioritized a return to Intel’s engineering foundation while cultivating an innovative and accountable culture. Ambitious aims and a willingness to take chances characterized his tenure, which contrasts sharply with the Giants’ more cautious strategy.</p>\n<h3>Legacy Is a Double-Edged Sword</h3>\n<p>The Giants and Intel are both burdened by their histories. The Giants’ rich past makes them feel both proud and burdened, which makes their recent setbacks even more disappointing. Because of the team’s illustrious background, supporters find it challenging to make sense of its current hardships in light of its former success.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Being a pioneer in its industry comes with expectations, which Intel also struggles with. The impact of the company’s errors is exacerbated by its standing as a technology innovator. However, Intel’s heritage offers distinct advantages, including a wealth of technical know-how, solid industry ties, and a still enviable reputation, especially with legacy PC OEMs like HP, Dell, and Lenovo. These resources have put Intel in a position to build on its prior achievements and focus on future expansion.</p>\n<h3>Extended Future for Intel</h3>\n<p>The timelines of their various sectors represent one of the most considerable distinctions between Intel and the Giants. NFL teams follow an annual cycle, and their fortunes frequently fluctuate depending on how one season turns out. Failures are front-page news, and because of their immediacy, it has become challenging for the Giants to bounce back from in the near future.</p>\n<p>Timelines are lengthier in the tech sector, though. Years pass during semiconductor development cycles, and strategic choices cannot have their full effects for ten years.</p>\n<p>Intel has more time to accomplish its ambitions and bounce back from setbacks because of this longer horizon. While Intel’s problems have been more gradual and (in theory) allow for course correction and progressive development, Wall Street is typically not patient, and investors get nervous when they don’t sense positive signs of leading indicators like market share gains and revenue increases.</p>\n<h3>Intel’s Path Ahead</h3>\n<p>Despite its struggles, Intel is not a business that is content to let things go. Intel is setting itself up for a long-term resurgence with its IDM 2.0 strategy, AI initiatives, and redoubled emphasis on silicon excellence.</p>\n<p>Some now contend that Intel will never regain its position as the semiconductor industry leader, and its issues are so complicated that they might not be resolved. Due to the company’s manufacturing delays, AMD and Nvidia have increased market share, further widening the gap as Intel prepares for the 18A production phase.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Intel’s foundry sector has had trouble attracting customers, which has made its recovery attempts more difficult. Pat Gelsinger’s resignation highlights the need for strong leadership and creative ideas after his tenure saw a significant drop in stock value. Restoring investor trust and industry stature will need strategic restructuring and a fresh emphasis on execution, which will be highly challenging due to internal resistance to whoever takes over as Intel’s leader.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to forget that many analysts welcomed Gelsinger’s return to Intel in 2021 with hope because they thought his familiarity with the firm, his grasp of the silicon industry, his focus on customers, and his visionary attributes were precisely what was required to turn the giant around.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>However, under his direction, Intel had endeavored to overcome several obstacles, such as a lag in manufacturing improvements and heightened competition from rivals like AMD and Nvidia. Due to these problems, Intel’s stock value significantly dropped, wiping out almost $150 billion in market capitalization.</p>\n<p>Although some have claimed that Gelsinger just needed more time to carry out his plan effectively, the company’s board thought differently and finally decided that a drastic change in direction, starting with a change in CEO, was required.</p>\n<p>Despite being interesting and even amusing, the connection between Intel and the 2024 New York Giants ultimately falls short considering all that.</p>\n<p>Even if both organizations are going through difficult times, Intel’s approach shows a degree of strategic vision and flexibility that the Giants have not yet shown. Intel is building the foundation for a future that solidifies its position as a leader in the technology industry, not just battling to remain relevant. If Intel is a behemoth, it is undergoing reinvention rather than decline, which it must do if the company is to grow.</p>\n<p>There are reasons to be optimistic for Intel. Its Lunar Lake family of processors is showing favorable performance and battery life comparisons to Apple Silicon and even offerings from Qualcomm, which has made a great deal of favorable news with its Snapdragon Elite solutions for laptops.</p>\n<h3>High Stakes for Intel’s Next CEO</h3>\n<p>Intel’s incoming CEO, whoever that might be, will have one of the greatest corporate turnaround challenges in tech history. The company will have to dramatically cut headcount, which makes Intel’s cut of 15,000 people earlier in the year look like a pinprick.</p>\n<p>Intel seems committed to its foundry strategy, which will require years of investment before it yields significant returns. In a post-Biden Administration world, the company may be unable to rely on the federal government for further investment in its foundry business. To top all of that, some customers may not be comfortable with Intel’s “church and state” strategy of manufacturing non-Intel chips in Intel factories.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Intel’s chances for success will largely depend on its new leader. I advise hiring someone from the outside who is not an Intel insider who might be influenced by legacy Intel personnel who have developed a survival mentality and are reluctant to take risks. Intel’s new CEO will likely be the most-watched tech hire of 2025, as their leadership will provide critical insights into the company’s future.</p>\n<p>The new CEO will also have to deal with a management team who have remained the many cuts the company has gone through and might be unwilling to make the necessary changes Intel must undertake, as legacy management will be in “survivor” mode and unlikely to take risks.</p>\n<p>As for the Giants, I’m horrified to state that I’m not optimistic. For the first time in my 46 years as a season ticket holder (shelling out over $200,000 during that period), I’m contemplating giving them up. Or maybe I’ll just play Madden 2025 on my Xbox One for the remainder of the season and not waste my team watching Big Blue suffer.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Intel, it is not at that point. The company controls its destiny, but time is not on its side, so its incoming CEO must show results quickly and tangibly.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A call for organizations to take quantum security seriously has been sounded in a new report by <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester Research</a>.</p>\n<p>The report titled “Quantum Security Isn’t Hype — Every Security Leader Needs It” acknowledged that the commercial availability of quantum computers that can crack traditional asymmetric cryptography is still five to 10 years away. However, it added that organizations must assess and prepare for the impact of quantum security now.</p>\n<p>While the encryption market has a history of vendors publishing incredible claims like “unbreakable encryption,” the hype and interest around quantum is real because hackers are already using the “harvest now, decrypt later” approach, noted the report written by research director Merritt Maxim and analysts Andras Cser, Sandy Carielli, and Heidi Shey.</p>\n<p>Organizations need to start preparing now to secure their resources from attacks from quantum computers since it will take them years to do it because the transition won’t be totally under their control, explained Carielli. “There’s a lot of reliance on third parties,” she told TechNewsWorld, “and reliance on vendors upgrading their technology so you can upgrade yours.”</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of steps along the way,” she continued, “so I think you’re talking in terms of numbers of years, and that’s why we’ve always been saying start now, even if this is not something that will come into play for another five or 10 or whatever years. It will potentially take that long to complete the migration.”</p>\n<h3>Harvest Now, Decrypt Later</h3>\n<p>Jamie Boote, associate principal security consultant at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>, an applications security company in Burlington, Mass., asserted that quantum computing would disrupt decades-old conventions in terms of how well current encryption algorithms can safeguard sensitive data.</p>\n<p>“An entire generation of professionals has lived with the slow cycling of encryption algorithms in and out as computers grew faster at a predictable rate, and this is going to throw that cadence away,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This change isn’t going to be instant, and it’s not going to be easy, but the more we can prepare our infrastructure to just work in the post-quantum computing era, the fewer incidents stemming from unmaintained or older components will occur.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a saying that ‘The best time to plant a shade tree was twenty years ago, the second-best time is today,’ but right now, we’re living at a point where it is the best time to plant that metaphorical shade tree of security to enjoy the benefits when the time is right,” he added.</p>\n<p>Organizations should also be getting their quantum security efforts into gear because “harvest now, decrypt efforts” are being conducted by nation-states and cybercriminals. “Industries that have data that needs to remain private for years into the future are at most risk of harvest now, decrypt later,” explained Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.qusecure.com\">QuSecure</a>, a maker of quantum-safe security solutions, in San Mateo, Calif.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to data like national security information, bank account information, data that’s valuable year after year — when a quantum computer does come online, it can decrypt that stockpiled data,” she told TechNewsWorld. “That’s why we see governments and banks moving very quickly to start addressing the quantum threat, even though there is no quantum computer that exists today that will break today’s encryption.”</p>\n<h3>Valuable Exercise</h3>\n<p>Preparing for “Q-Day” — even if it never arrives — can be an incredibly valuable exercise, maintained Richard Stiennon, founder and chief research analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://it-harvest.com/\">IT-Harvest</a>, a cybersecurity industry analyst firm in Birmingham, Mich.</p>\n<p>“You should be doing it anyway,” he told TechNewsWorld. “You should be discovering all the places you have encrypted data. That will tell you where your family jewels are. And it’ll tell you the size and scope of problems you’ve got.”</p>\n<p>“Now you’ve probably got all this encrypted data all over the place,” he said. “You don’t know who owns the keys or how to get to them. They’re probably insecure. They’re probably old and need to be re-keyed. So, you have to think about getting your hands around this, right? How do you find all the encrypted data? Find the way it’s encrypted so you can decrypt and re-encrypt it if you need to?”</p>\n<p>“When you talk to some end users, they don’t know what’s being protected by cryptography,” added Heather West, senior research analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a market research company in Framingham, Mass.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“For some, it’s a mixture of different types of solutions,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Some have band-aid solutions. Some just don’t know. So, you first need to understand what data and infrastructure are most at risk. Then you need to know what you’re doing to protect it and figure out which post-quantum cryptography algorithms would be best suited for protecting it.”</p>\n<p>However, Luigi Caramico, co-founder and CTO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://datakrypto.com\">DataKrypto</a>, a cloud encryption company in Burlingame, Calif., warned against investing too much effort today in quantum-resistant solutions.</p>\n<p>“An encryption method considered quantum-proof today may not remain secure in the future,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Instead, I would prioritize addressing present-day vulnerabilities, such as the ‘encryption gap’ — the need to decrypt when it’s in use — which poses an immediate and tangible risk to data security.”</p>\n<p>“Investing heavily in today’s “quantum-proof” solutions could also be risky,” he added. “Some of these algorithms may eventually be found vulnerable to classical attacks, let alone quantum ones. A better strategy is quantum agility — ensuring cryptographic systems can be updated as stronger and more thoroughly vetted algorithms emerge.”</p>\n<h3>Quantum Security Demands Crypto-Agility</h3>\n<p>Quantum security and crypto-agility — the ability to replace and upgrade cryptographic — algorithms in infrastructure, commercial and in-house-built applications — will improve the security of any information exchange, improve digital signatures, and mitigate the risk of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks, the Forrester report noted.</p>\n<p>Quantum security will force an overhaul of systems across an organization, and organizations will need to upgrade their entire security stack to ensure crypto-agility for the future to protect their data, it added.</p>\n<p>“Crypto-agility is crucial in today’s fast-evolving digital environment, where new technologies, algorithms, and security challenges require constant adaptation,” said Tim Callan, chief compliance officer at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\">Sectigo</a>, a global digital certificate provider.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“This need for agility will become even more critical as we approach the PQC [Post Quantum Computing] era, with the potential for rapid algorithm deprecation,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Because algorithmic trust is imperfect, organizations must use this opportunity to design security that is modular and enable algorithms to easily be swapped in and out like security Legos,” Matt Mittelsteadt, a research fellow at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“If any of these algorithms are found insecure, which is indeed possible, organizations that design with modularity in mind will be able to quickly swap in a replacement and maintain security,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Trillion-Dollar Risk</h3>\n<p>“The Forrester report is exactly right about the threat of quantum computers,” asserted Stefan Leichenauer, vice president of engineering at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sandboxaq.com\">SandboxAQ</a>, a developer of B2B and quantum software in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>\n<p>“In as little as five years, we could see a quantum computer crack traditional cryptography, and because of ‘hack now, decrypt later’ attacks, the vulnerability exists today,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Even if we have doubts about whether a quantum computer will arrive in that timeframe — maybe you think it’s only a 10% chance — a modest probability of a trillion-dollar-loss event is still a big problem,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen a number of recent announcements from the quantum computing industry showing that the roadmap is advancing, so our confidence that quantum computers are coming has only gone up,” he added.</p>\n<p>“Every organization needs to evaluate their cryptographic posture, which begins with a careful inventory of their use of encryption and then a crypto-agile migration to post-quantum key exchanges. It’s a multi-year process, so the time to start is now.”</p>\n",

It can go a little bit longer in developing markets. But the reason they do that is not because the hardware isn’t good. It’s usually because of the software.”</p>\n<p>“Businesses can only go so long before they refresh. You’re not gonna keep a PC for 10 years in a business,” added Jack E. Gold, founder and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jgoldassociates.com/\">J.Gold Associates</a>, an IT advisory company in Northborough, Mass.</p>\n<p>“Covid brought in a ton of new machines three, three and a half, years ago,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Most companies refresh on a three-year basis. So we’re gonna see an uptick in business buying of PCs.”</p>\n<h3>End of Days for Win10</h3>\n<p>Jessop added that a significant factor contributing to PC shipment growth in 2024, which will continue in 2025, is the size and age of the installed hardware base. “It’s never been larger or older than now,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>That’s why Canalys forecasts that commercial PC shipments will continue to outgrow consumer shipments. “Consumer price sensitivity and budget prioritization mean many people are delaying their next purchase,” Jessop explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Another factor stoking PC shipments is Microsoft’s announcement that it will stop supporting Windows 10 in October 2025. “Hundreds of millions of those old PCs are ineligible to update to Windows 11, so businesses will be nudged toward refreshing their devices,” Jessop said.</p>\n<p>“Microsoft is getting increasingly aggressive in letting customers know that support is going to be ending, and they really need to upgrade to Windows 11,” added Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Given the relatively stringent requirements for that, the only way to do so is to purchase a new computer,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>AI PCs Puzzle Consumers</h3>\n<p>Jessop cited the introduction of AI PCs into the market as an influencer of growth. “They’re being positioned as a halo category and are being used to open the door to conversations around a wider fleet refresh,” he said.</p>\n<p>Paul Schell, an industry analyst with global technology intelligence firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abiresearch.com/\">ABI Research</a>, sees AI PCs as having a significant impact on growth. “We continue to see the introduction of AI PCs, and in particular notebooks/laptops, as being the driving force behind a shortening of refresh cycles,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“In the AI PC segment, challenger Qualcomm has expanded its portfolio to include fewer premium chipsets — including an SKU targeting the $600 laptop range — which has a democratizing effect, as the first releases from all vendors, including Apple, Intel and AMD, were more premium,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Jessop, though, noted that despite the hype around the PCs at CES last week, the computers have failed to generate much excitement among buyers. “Many channel partners we surveyed indicated that their customers are either unaware of Copilot+ PCs or are unwilling to pay a premium price for them, even if they are aware,” he noted.</p>\n<p>“This dual challenge limits the ability of the category to create a strong aspirational pull or halo effect,” he continued. “Customers are prioritizing pricing over perceived innovation, suggesting the value proposition for Copilot+ PCs needs stronger articulation or refining.”</p>\n<p>AI PCs will be a big deal in 2025, contended Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas. “With special chips called NPUs [Neural Processing Units], they’re great for tasks like AI, language processing, and predicting things,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Businesses and people will want PCs that can use AI to make their work easier, more creative, and more automated.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/chart-AI-capable-PC-shipments-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Forecast of worldwide PC and AI-capable PC shipments, showing AI PCs projected to account for 35% of shipments by Q4 2025.\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/chart-AI-capable-PC-shipments-2025.jpg 900w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/chart-AI-capable-PC-shipments-2025-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/chart-AI-capable-PC-shipments-2025-768x427.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"></p>\n<p>“I’m not convinced — yet — that AI will be a dominating factor, but as AI usage models become more compelling, AI PCs will become more attractive to the average mainstream user,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eric Compton, director of technology equity research at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago, maintained that 2025 will be the same as 2024 in terms of fueling growth in PC shipments.</p>\n<p>“The continued PC refresh cycle and the need to replace machines purchased during the boom years of 2020 and 2021 will be the primary factors,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If AI PCs can improve their functionality and generate some more unique demand, this could be a wildcard for additional demand.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>When we started with digital assistants, Microsoft potentially had the inside track. Its Cortana effort was named after the Halo AI character, which gave it far more potential than the others.</p>\n<p>Apple had a decent shot, too. It marketed Siri very well but didn’t seem to want to fund its advancement, while Amazon just shipped product after product that used Alexa.</p>\n<p>Google was no slouch either, pivoting hard to its Gemini product (which I use a lot) for Pixel smartphones.</p>\n<p>What I find fascinating is that Panos Panay, the guy who pretty much made the Microsoft Surface line a thing and drove my favorite phone, the Surface Duo, is now at Amazon and apparently doing there what should have happened at Microsoft with Cortana.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss how we got here, what to expect, and why this move from Amazon will be a game-changer. We’ll close with my Product of the Week: AMD’s new RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft’s Cortana Failure</h3>\n<p>Microsoft was one of the first to introduce a believable AI assistant. What made it believable was that it was named after a character in the Halo video game. To make it work, Microsoft needed to advance this technology and make it look like it did in the game.</p>\n<p>You might have thought this was a stretch, but an engineer working on his own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggE3VI3NRg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">created</a> exactly what this would have looked like, and it worked. Imagine how this would have set the stage and provided a huge competitive advantage for the company once generative AI was driving into the market years later. It would have been the centerpiece of any tech-forward home, particularly for those of us who got hooked on Halo back in the day.</p>\n<p>Then, instead of becoming the digital assistant that would rule them all, Microsoft did what it so often does these days: it underfunded and under-executed the effort with virtually no help from marketing and eventually pulled the plug on it years before generative AI became a thing.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s Siri Misstep</h3>\n<p>Apple also had a shot at this race with Siri, which was, compared to Microsoft, far better marketed and executed even though, like Cortana, it really wasn’t AI so much as a text-to-speech, speech-to-text interface for the web. Apple had more people using Siri than any of the alternatives, but the promise of Siri that the ads tended to convey was well short of Siri’s reality.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Even today, when I’m on a panel discussing AI, someone almost always points to Siri and argues that it isn’t AI because it sets such a bad example.</p>\n<p>Apple had the opportunity as part of its now failed partnership with IBM (who saw that coming?) to have Siri be the front-end for IBM’s watsonx, which would have made Siri into the first digital assistant that was a true AI. But that partnership was virtually dead on arrival, largely because Apple just doesn’t work well with partners. While IBM has a far better partnership skill set, even IBM couldn’t save the thing.</p>\n<p>Siri remains in use — though that may change now that Apple can spell AI — but it’s still the disappointment it has always been.</p>\n<h3>Alexa Surprise</h3>\n<p>Amazon has lost billions on Alexa. However, arguing that Alexa is a failure is unfounded mainly because many users order products from Amazon using Alexa. Unlike the others, Amazon saw the potential to create a front end for the retail business and use the digital assistant to remind and help people to order stuff and become a trusted part of their day.</p>\n<p>I know we often start our day asking Alexa about the weather and end the day asking Alexa about actors in shows (for those not using Amazon X-Ray, which is a truly handy feature available with Amazon streaming content) or getting color on the limited information we’re watching on TV.</p>\n<p>Even though, just like Cortana was, and Siri is, Alexa is more of a web front end than true AI and has proven far more useful. The only thing we use almost as much is Google’s digital assistant, which, for some reason, doesn’t have a cute name.</p>\n<p>What will change in the coming weeks is that Alexa moves to generative AI. Granted, that move was promised in 2023, but this turned out to be more difficult than they thought. Still, it is better to do something well than quickly — and while this feature will only be for Prime members, so it is not truly free, the result should be a huge improvement in this technology class.</p>\n<p>The generative AI assistant will be called Alexa+. It will work on most Alexa devices, a smartphone app, and the Amazon website. So, although Amazon wasn’t first, didn’t have a game to connect to, and was more of a retailer than a tech company, it out-executed Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Google is arguably a distant second with its planned implementation in Pixel phones, which may be a problem for me because I carry a Pixel phone, and I might prefer Alexa+.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Alexa+</h3>\n<p>If you aren’t working with AI, you should start because you’ll need that skill set to do many things in the second half of this decade. AI can handle complex questions with detailed answers, generate content, offer nuanced advice, and even assist with productivity.</p>\n<p>Alexa+ will let up jump to scenes in movies you own or rent on Amazon’s video service, ask for unique playlists on Amazon Music, and get far better answers than just a reading of a web page that Alexa would have previously defaulted to.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>You’ll be able to use natural language rather than the Alexa commands you need to learn, and you’ll be able to give it complex, multi-step directions based on historical knowledge. For example, you can ask it to book the same place for your anniversary that you booked last year, purchase tickets at specified prices, or even recommend and contact repair services for something broken.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>With the Rink security cameras — and this is huge — you could ask Alexa+ to show you any images of people who have been frequenting your property, how often your kids are actually walking the dog, or to figure out where your cat is (assuming a camera has or can see it).</p>\n<p>There will likely be some quality problems because AI developers aren’t focusing enough on quality yet, which I think is a huge mistake. So you’ll want to be careful about taking everything Alexa+ says as fact. There will likely be some issues with third-party applications until they become fully integrated, but this is huge, and I think it will change how we look at digital assistants going forward.</p>\n<p>Panos Panay wasn’t able to execute at Microsoft, though I know he tried — so it’s great to see Amazon give him what he needed to perform there.

      "content": "<p>In an apparent attempt to keep pace with its rival Uber, ride-hailing service Lyft plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis in Dallas “as soon as 2026.”</p>\n<p>According to a report Monday in TechCrunch, the new robocabs will be powered by Mobileye technology while Marubeni, a Japanese conglomerate, will perform fleet management. When operational, ride seekers will be able to hail a robotaxi through Lyft’s app.</p>\n<p>Although Lyft hasn’t revealed the carmaker for the program, TechCrunch noted that Mobileye technology is already integrated into vehicles made by Ford, General Motors, Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan, and others.</p>\n<p>“Mobileye has been around for more than 20 years and is a global leader in advanced driver assist systems,” noted Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at <a href=\"https://telemetryagency.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Telemetry Insights</a>, a Detroit-based transportation research and advisory company.</p>\n<p>“Most cars on the road have some sort of forward collision alert or lane-keeping assist system based on Mobileye technology,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>While Lyft hasn’t revealed how many vehicles it will launch in Dallas, its Executive Vice President of Driver Experience, Jeremy Bird, told TechCrunch that the company plans to scale to thousands of vehicles across multiple cities after the Texas debut.</p>\n<p>Lyft rival Uber has already announced it’s teaming up with Waymo to offer robotaxi services in Austin and Atlanta. Meanwhile, Tesla plans to launch an autonomous ride-hail offering in Austin in June.</p>\n<h3>Lyft’s Asset-Light Strategy for Robotaxis</h3>\n<p>“Lyft’s initiative is likely in response to Uber, which has made aggressive moves to form partnerships for autonomous vehicles,” said Edward Sanchez, a senior analyst in the automotive practice of <a href=\"https://www.techinsights.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechInsights</a>, a global technology intelligence company.</p>\n<p>He noted that Lyft’s “asset-light” approach to operations explains its partnership with Marubeni. “Lyft, like Uber, is taking a somewhat incremental approach to commercializing robotaxi service,” Sanchez told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said full-scale robotaxi commercialization will be a longer-term pursuit due to the high current cost of autonomous vehicles — often more than US$200,000 — and currently higher operational costs than human-driven vehicles.</p>\n<p>“Uber and Lyft built their business on the idea that they don’t own anything,” Abuelsamid explained. “The only thing they own is their software platform.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“They don’t own any vehicles,” he continued. “They don’t have to put fuel in them. They don’t have to insure them or maintain them. That’s problematic for robotaxis because now you have to find somebody that’s going to own, operate, and maintain those vehicles.”</p>\n<p>“So there’s a lot of new kinds of operational challenges and operational expenses associated with robotaxis that you don’t have with a human-driven vehicle when you’re relying on somebody else bringing their own vehicle to your platform,” he said.</p>\n<p>“They are responsible for all of that stuff. That is not part of your cost of doing business. When you go to a robotaxi, all of a sudden, all of that stuff becomes part of your cost of doing business.”</p>\n<h3>Tesla’s Contrarian Approach</h3>\n<p>Sanchez added that although Tesla is widely considered the leader in terms of miles driven and geographical coverage of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) service, due to extensive data ingestion from its cumulative fleet of vehicles, it has only recently showcased its specific approach to robotaxis with the Cybercab.</p>\n<p>“It’s also somewhat unclear if Tesla will pursue a company-operated fleet at scale or simply operate as a platform to enable individual owners to use Cybercabs — or presumably other Teslas with fully autonomous capability — as an entrepreneurial venture,” he said.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Cybercab.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla Cybercab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Cybercab.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Cybercab-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Cybercab-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Cybercab (Image Credit: Tesla)</p>\n<p>He noted that Tesla has historically been highly vertically integrated and has often taken a contrarian approach to technologies. One noteworthy example is Tesla’s shunning of Lidar in its suite of autonomous sensing technologies, while much of the rest of the industry has been embracing it or considering it a “mandatory” technology for safe AV operation.</p>\n<p>“Tesla refuses to use any other type of sensors, which I think is a fundamental mistake,” Abuelsamid said. “I don’t think that they are going to be able to build a viable robotaxi platform with a camera-only system. It’s not robust enough.”</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t work well in low light conditions,” he continued. “It doesn’t work well in fog or rain. It’s cheaper, but it does not have the robustness of a system that uses multiple types of sensors.”</p>\n<h3>Can Robotaxis Win Consumer Confidence?</h3>\n<p>Mark Giarelli, an equity analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago, views Lyft as a laggard in the robotaxi partnership race.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing to remember here is that Lyft has a way smaller value proposition to autonomous vehicle manufacturers compared to what Uber offers because Lyft’s network of drivers and riders is so much smaller than Uber’s,” Giarelli told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“If an AV company partners with Uber, they are guaranteeing access to 75% of the U.S. rideshare market, but if they partner with Lyft, they are only getting access to 20% to 25% of the U.S. rideshare market,” he explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>During this early chapter in the robotaxi story, the technology has faced some challenges. “It’s not been an easy rollout,” said Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“Deploying robotaxis in cities face major challenges such as regulatory hurdles, with complex and evolving approval processes that vary by region,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Technical difficulties arise from navigating dense urban environments filled with unpredictable obstacles like pedestrians, cyclists, and construction zones.”</p>\n<p>“Additionally, achieving public trust and ensuring safety at scale remain significant obstacles, especially after high-profile incidents involving autonomous vehicles,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., agreed that getting people comfortable with the technology has been a problem. “The large-scale trials have had issues with noise, navigation errors, and glitches stranding some riders,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“They are still largely safer than human-driven cars, but when something bad happens, because they are new, the accident gets an unusual amount of attention, creating the false impression the technology is unsafe,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Growing Consumer Comfort With Robotaxis</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, there are signs that consumers are getting more comfortable with the technology. In its second U.S. Robotaxi Experience study released in October, <a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">J.D. Power</a> found consumer satisfaction with the robotaxi experience to be 8.53 on a 10-point scale.</p>\n<p>The consumer research, data, and analytics firm in Troy, Mich., also reported that consumer confidence when riding in a fully automated, self-driving vehicle is 56 percentage points higher among those who have ridden in a robotaxi (76%) than the general population who have not had the experience (20%).</p>\n<p>Kathleen Rizk, Power’s senior director of user experience benchmarking and technology, acknowledged, however, that many consumers with robotaxi experience tend to be early adopters.</p>\n<p>“What we find with early adopters of technology is they don’t always expect technology to work perfectly when it’s brand new, but they want to be part of that experience,” Rizk told TechNewsWorld. “So they may experience an issue, but they’re more willing to overlook it as part of the technology — like a bug being worked out.”</p>\n<p>The study also revealed that when given a series of scenarios assuming the cost for either service would be the same, 77% of riders say they would prefer to utilize a robotaxi service without a human driver when needing to have a private conversation in the vehicle. In contrast, a ride-hailing service, such as Uber or Lyft, is preferred when traveling in an area they don’t know well.</p>\n<p>“Whether it’s a taxi, ride-hailing, or robotaxi, what it’s ultimately going to come down to is affordability for the consumer,” Rizk said.</p>\n<p>That time, although years away, will eventually come. Enderle predicted: “By 2035, finding a human-driven taxi will be as hard as finding a robotaxi today.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Large-scale weather events are becoming increasingly common, and the tendency to build back after a disaster without upgrading the buildings to prevent another one would be foolish. For decades, Los Angeles (L.A.) has had some of the strongest building codes for earthquakes and localized fires, but large-scale fire events are new to the region and appear to be a trend.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are a variety of technologies and approaches to rebuilding after the fires are put out. Still, aggressive action at the state, county, and city levels will be needed to ensure that policies and rules are updated to provide architects and builders with clear guidance as to what will be allowed for new structures so that this kind of disaster doesn’t repeat itself in the future.</p>\n<p>This week, let’s explore strategies like fire-resistant materials, advanced building technologies, and innovative housing solutions to rebuild and adapt for a safer future. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week: the Google Pixel Watch 3, which my wife gave me last Christmas.</p>\n<h3>Hardening Homes Against Wildfires</h3>\n<p>I grew up in Orange County, Calif., and trained to fight fires. I now live in Bend, Ore., where we tend to have big fires every year.</p>\n<p>Last year, my wife asserted that we needed an SUV or trailer big enough to escape a fire should one approach our home. I argued that it would make more sense to harden our house against fire so we could shelter in place because, as we saw in prior fires, and with the L.A. fires, getting out can be problematic given the roads tend to become quickly clogged with evacuating residents and fire teams trying to get in.</p>\n<p>Like most homes in the area, our house is primarily constructed of wood and unlikely to survive a fire. We replaced the roof with a combination of insulation and metal. We installed solar panels and Tesla batteries in case of power outages and replaced our siding with fire-resistant <a href=\"https://www.jameshardie.com/blog/siding-durability/fire-resistant-siding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hardie Board</a>, which will smoke if heated but won’t combust.</p>\n<p>We are located near a river and have a swim spa, both of which could be used as water sources should the hydrant system become oversubscribed as it did in L.A. We’ve also put in <a href=\"https://rollashield.com/residential/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rolling shutters</a> that can further insulate the house from a fire and protect the windows from breaking, which helps prevent fire from entering the home.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Our next step is to install an external home anti-fire sprinkler system that will help keep the house from combusting, given the house is still wood-framed. The service we are looking at is <a href=\"https://www.frontlinewildfire.com/protect-home-with-roof-wildfire-sprinkler-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Frontline</a>, which specializes in home wildfire defense.</p>\n<p>The cost for this kind of retrofitting is steep. The roof was approximately $20,000, the siding cost around $40,000, the shutters (automatic) were between $2,000 to $5,000 per window, and the Frontline sprinkler system was between $20,000 and $40,000. However, the result is that the structure should now survive external fire events and allow us to shelter in place safely.</p>\n<p>As I was finishing this column, my wife shared a link to a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/these-l-a-homeowners-installed-private-fire-hydrants-here-s-how-they-fared/ar-AA1xknsY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">story</a> of one of the surviving homes.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the homeowner had paid between $100,000 and $150,000 to install his own fire hydrant and rigged a high-performance pump that took over when the pressure dropped in the hydrant system. He saved his house and two others. So, a little foresight resulted in three families not struggling with insurance companies and FEMA and trying to find a place to live in a saturated rental market.</p>\n<p>I think the Frontline solution will have the same benefit for me, but this is something to think about.</p>\n<h3>Redesigning Los Angeles</h3>\n<p>As of this writing, the issue with the L.A. fires is that the homes were not designed to withstand wildfires. The hydrant system — and this is the problem with most of them — can’t maintain pressure in a wildfire, access was problematic during evacuations, the ability to respond to a fire was too slow, and the winds were near hurricane levels, rendering aircraft mostly useless until the winds dropped.</p>\n<p>This last means that current firefighting technology is inadequate to address fires of this magnitude. Like earthquakes, homes need to be built to withstand the fire rather than relying on central firefighting resources to put the fires out.</p>\n<p>In addition, the government will have significant revenue problems coupled with substantial increases in spending as it recovers from this damage. Revenues from property taxes will be reduced, and a massive number of people are unlikely to be able to pay even the reduced amount, given that they are now homeless (and possibly jobless). Federal funds won’t be enough to rebuild.</p>\n<p>Many of these now-homeless homeowners have lost their fire insurance, and getting insurance on a new, similar structure may be impossible.</p>\n<p>These cities need to rebuild fast. They need to build new structures that are far more fire resistant, and they need to rethink many of these areas so that they can be better defended should fires recur, as they likely will.</p>\n<h3>Rebuilding Fast With Manufactured Homes</h3>\n<p>One way to rebuild fast is by using approved manufactured homes. I’m not talking typical mobile homes, which are often considered unsafe in high winds and are not particularly fire resistant, but manufactured homes like <a href=\"https://modernprefabs.com/prefab-homes/blu-homes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blu Homes</a> that are designed like aircraft to withstand a variety of extreme weather events and can be put up on an existing foundation in a matter of hours.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>These homes are manufactured mainly with fire-resistant materials and tested to be wind-resistant. Depending on supply, they can be assembled very quickly by relatively small teams of people so that homeowners can get back into their homes rapidly.</p>\n<p>Blu Homes packages typically include all fixtures and major appliances installed before shipping, making them ideal for this kind of problem. Prices for a Blu Home range from $285,000 to $635,000 but can exceed this range depending on the number of modules and accessories.</p>\n<h3>3D Printing Fire-Resistant Homes</h3>\n<p>This newer technology typically uses a special cement that can be applied through a nozzle to build a home quickly. 3D-printed homes are highly fire resistant if you don’t put a flammable roof on them. They can be built in a few days with a small crew (generally around three to four people) and can be designed to order.</p>\n<p>A 3D-printed home typically <a href=\"https://kingroon.com/blogs/3d-printing-guides/3d-printed-house-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costs</a> in the range of $30,000 and $100,000, though larger homes can be more expensive than the $150,000 to $450,000 cost of a more traditionally built home.</p>\n<p>Often, building codes have to be altered to accept 3D-printed homes, and given how fast they go up, timely inspections in a disaster area can be problematic during the build. However, this technology is likely the fastest method to rebuild with fewer workers. Although the first 3D-printed homes did look pretty strange, later structures combined building methods. This video shows one of the newer designs that looks far more traditional.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"East 17th Street Residences — Launch Video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTMhk1_ehwA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>Saving money and getting back into a home quickly make this technology nearly ideal, except for one big problem: Few contractors have the needed equipment and training right now. This suggests that a government-funded effort to subsidize training and equipping builders would be timely in L.A. if they want to build back quickly and restore tax revenues.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Modernizing Building Codes for Fire Safety</h3>\n<p>We need to rethink building codes. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91260499/no-shrubs-and-lots-of-concrete-this-is-what-a-fire-resistant-house-looks-like\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this architect</a> specialized in fire-resistant homes, but the city’s requirements resulted in avoidable damage due to outdated building codes.</p>\n<p>This effort needs to start with regulatory agencies rethinking building codes to enable more fire-resistant and advanced building methods to address this need. Buildings need to be safe, but regulatory bodies tend to move very slowly when updating codes for fear of litigation should they get it wrong.</p>\n<p>Still, unless these governments step up and rethink their codes with regard to these extreme weather events, people are likely to flee their cities as unsafe and unaffordable.</p>\n<p>As I write this, utility companies are again being <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/why-la-county-firestorms-might-be-a-significant-test-of-the-states-wildfire-fund/ar-AA1xeQwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> of starting some of these recent fires.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cause, a more effective sensor and response network is essential to catch fires while they are still small and containable. This calls for advanced drone firefighting technologies and greater reliance on satellites for early fire detection. Current technology falls short, and we are not utilizing AI, drones, or sensors to their full potential.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> We need to build neighborhoods that can better survive events like this, but it starts with cities resetting priorities to reflect the changed world.</p>\n<p>One final idea is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arcology</a>, which is a very large structure that can be more easily protected and houses a town or city with living, working, and recreational facilities inside. These would be vastly easier to protect from the increasingly dangerous weather events we anticipate. As our weather degrades, this may be the only viable solution short of migrating to another planet that will reliably keep people safe.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Google Pixel Watch 3</h3>\n<p>I used to collect mechanical watches but moved to smartwatches some time ago.

It builds in Fitbit functionality for accurate exercise recording, and there is an LTE version for $100 more (which I didn’t get, sadly).</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Google Pixel Watch 3 | Big Screen, Bigger Strides\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLAC75BeGjI\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The watch’s screen is up to 2000 nits, which makes it highly usable outside. However, it burns through the battery far faster (two days) than my old TicWatch. Charging is done through a magnetic charger rather than wireless inductive charging, similar to every smartwatch I’ve owned, but not as well as the Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 is particularly useful for competitive runners as it measures your time and distance and compares it to past efforts, pushing you to exceed them. It will integrate with other Google devices like the Nest Camera to see images on the watch or Google TV as the remote control, and it will work as an interface to your phone so you can chat with your watch (not all smartwatches do this).</p>\n<p>The watch also has several safety features, including a timer that will trigger an alert if the time you set expires (say you’re on a questionable date or have a sketchy Uber driver) and fall detection that sends alerts if you have a hard fall. You can notify contacts from the watch of your location or let them know you can’t answer because you are already on a call.</p>\n<p>You can buy replacement bands for the watch, including metal ones, but I’m fine with the one it came with. The watch is water resistant down to 50 meters. Oh, and you can get up to $300 back if you trade in your old watch (which I didn’t do).</p>\n<p>While the Pixel Watch 3 isn’t as feature-rich or has as long battery life as my old TicWatch Pro 5, it is more comfortable, does a better job tracking my sleep and steps, and is easier to use, making it my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple on Monday announced a $500 billion investment in the United States over the next four years, a commitment that includes the development of a state-of-the-art data center in Houston.</p>\n<p>This facility will be crucial in producing servers for Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI-driven system, to enhance user productivity and creativity.</p>\n<p>Apple’s decision to establish such a critical infrastructure in Texas underscores the state’s growing technological prominence and highlights the factors that make it a prime destination for significant tech investments.</p>\n<h3>Texas Business Climate Attracts Tech Giants</h3>\n<p>Thanks to its business-friendly environment, economic incentives, and robust infrastructure, Texas has long been a magnet for technology companies.</p>\n<p>One of the state’s most significant advantages is its favorable tax policies. Texas offers various incentives for businesses, including exemptions on sales and use taxes for equipment and electricity used in data centers. This attribute significantly lowers operational costs, making it an attractive location for companies looking to expand their footprint.</p>\n<p>Texas has a long history of tech investment dating back to the mid-1980s when Compaq Computer Corporation was founded. Compaq built the majority of its PCs and servers in Houston in elaborate manufacturing facilities before outsourcing production to Taiwan, courtesy of the lower costs offered by the likes of Foxconn, Quanta, and other ODMs (original design manufacturers).</p>\n<p>The Lone Star state also has no personal income tax, which can be a draw for highly skilled workers looking to relocate.</p>\n<h3>Texas Energy Edge Powers AI Data Centers</h3>\n<p>This is crucial: another key reason for Apple’s choice is Texas’ energy infrastructure. Data centers require vast amounts of electricity to power and cool servers. Texas boasts some of the most affordable energy rates in the country, with industrial rates as low as $0.06 per kilowatt-hour.</p>\n<p>This cost-effectiveness, combined with the state’s investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar, ensures a reliable and sustainable power supply. The abundance of energy makes Texas an ideal location for high-performance computing and AI-driven operations that demand constant uptime.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In addition to economic benefits, Texas offers a well-developed infrastructure that supports high-speed connectivity and efficient logistics. Major cities like Dallas and Houston are home to extensive fiber-optic networks, ensuring optimal performance for data centers. Houston, in particular, has developed into a growing tech hub with a concentration of enterprise IT services and data management firms.</p>\n<p>The state’s central location also makes it a strategic distribution point for national and global technology operations, reducing latency for cloud computing services.</p>\n<h3>Texas Talent Fuels Tech Expansion</h3>\n<p>Unlike traditional manufacturing facilities, AI data centers require highly experienced workers. For that reason, Texas’ workforce is another significant factor in Apple’s decision. The state is home to top-tier universities, such as the University of Texas at Austin, which produces thousands of engineering and computer science graduates annually.</p>\n<p>This steady talent pipeline provides tech companies with the skilled professionals to drive innovation and maintain operations. The concentration of tech talent in Austin, often called “Silicon Hills,” has already attracted major players like Tesla, Dell, and Oracle, further strengthening the region’s appeal.</p>\n<p>Apple’s investment will also bring substantial job creation, benefiting the local economy and the broader U.S. workforce. The Houston facility is expected to create thousands of jobs, spanning high-tech engineering, manufacturing, and facility operations.</p>\n<p>While data centers typically require large workforces during construction, the long-term employment opportunities they create — such as IT management and cybersecurity roles — contribute to developing a highly specialized workforce. This influx of employment and innovation will likely spur additional economic activity, benefiting local businesses and service providers.</p>\n<h3>Apple Expansion Bolsters U.S. Tech Independence</h3>\n<p>Beyond job creation, Apple’s investment aligns with broader national objectives to strengthen domestic manufacturing and technology independence. By onshoring the production of AI servers, Apple reduces its reliance on overseas supply chains and mitigates risks associated with global disruptions.</p>\n<p>This move also responds to recent policy shifts, including tariffs on imported goods, which have incentivized companies to reevaluate their manufacturing and logistics strategies.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Apple’s decision to invest heavily in Texas reflects the state’s growing reputation as a premier destination for tech giants. With its combination of low energy costs, business incentives, skilled workforce, and robust infrastructure, Texas offers an ideal environment for data centers and AI-driven operations.</p>\n<p>As Apple embarks on this ambitious expansion, it reinforces its commitment to U.S. manufacturing and helps solidify Texas’ position as a leader in the tech industry. This investment is expected to drive further innovation and economic growth, cementing Texas’ status as a top choice for high-tech enterprises looking to scale their operations in the years ahead.</p>\n<h3>Reality Check on Apple’s $500B Investment</h3>\n<p>Apple’s announcement of a $500 billion investment in the U.S., including data centers in Texas, may seem like a massive new commitment. However, it represents a cumulative figure that spans multiple years.</p>\n<p>Apple has consistently invested billions annually in U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and data centers. For example, in 2018, the company pledged to invest $350 billion over five years, and in 2021, it announced an additional $430 billion investment plan.</p>\n<p>The latest $500 billion figure likely includes previous commitments, ongoing expansions, and routine capital expenditures. While Apple’s continued investment in Texas is significant, the headline number can be misleading, as it doesn’t necessarily indicate a sudden increase in spending. Instead, it reflects Apple’s long-term growth strategy and ongoing infrastructure projects.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, while the focus on Texas aligns with Apple’s broader efforts to expand its data center footprint, the “new” investment scale is somewhat less dramatic than it appears.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Mobile applications are quietly attracting more and more malevolent attention — and for good reason. They contain a trove of private information about their users. In the iOS universe alone, 82.78%, or about 1.55 million apps, track private user data, according to the trends tracker <a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exploding Topics</a>.</p>\n<p>Mobile apps have also proven to be particularly vulnerable attack surfaces for cybercriminals. “Invisible” points of ingress and egress inside mobile apps can be compromised before legacy security tools even detect a breach. Those points include API calls, background syncing, and push notifications.</p>\n<p>Satish Swargam, principal security consultant at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>, an application security company in Burlington, Mass., explained that a mobile user can grant permissions in mobile apps. “Most users do not diligently apply the permissions and broadly grant permissions, allowing malicious apps to exploit these invisible points,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>What’s more, legacy tools often don’t identify suspicious behavior until it’s too late. AI-powered fraud can bypass multi-factor authentication, exploit memory-related bugs and vulnerabilities, and hijack transactions in real time.</p>\n<p>“AI has changed the entire landscape for protecting mobile consumers, mobile transactions, mobile revenue, and mobile experiences. It’s lowered the barrier to creating attacks,” said Tom Tovar, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.appdome.com\">Appdome</a>, maker of a security and integration platform for mobile developers and enterprise professionals, in Redwood City, Calif.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve seen a real dark renaissance around the use of AI to create attacks, enhance them, amplify them, and levy them against more and more consumers more easily than ever,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“If you’re in the defense business, it’s an amazing time,” he said. “But if you’re just an average everyday consumer, it’s a pretty scary time.”</p>\n<p>“AI-powered attacks both in the real world and with mobile apps are making it easier and faster for threat actors to <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/how-deepfakes-are-undermining-mobile-commerce-security-178221.html\">compromise systems</a>,” added Chris Hills, chief security strategist at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.beyondtrust.com/\">BeyondTrust</a>, a maker of privileged account management and vulnerability management solutions in Carlsbad, Calif.</p>\n<p>“AI trained for malicious purposes can easily scan, discover, expose, and exploit flaws much more quickly than a normal human could ever,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This is why the fight to harness AI for good purposes is so important.”</p>\n<h3>Mobile App Design Lacks Built-In Security</h3>\n<p>Mobile apps are tempting targets for threat actors because they’re everywhere and packed with valuable information, said T. Frank Downs, senior director of proactive services at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bluevoyant.com\">BlueVoyant</a>, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Think about all the personal data your apps have access to — from your location and contacts to your financial details,” he told TechNewsWorld. “With everyone constantly glued to their phones, the potential for data harvesting is enormous. Plus, the mobile app landscape is so diverse, with lots of operating systems and app stores, making it challenging to roll out security measures that fit every scenario.”</p>\n<p>In addition, many mobile apps aren’t securely designed. “Apps leak everything attackers need without resistance,” maintained Chris Wingfield, senior vice president for innovations at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.360privacy.io\">360 Privacy</a>, a digital privacy and security services provider in Nashville, Tenn.</p>\n<p>“Mobile apps constantly emit soft identifiers such as install IDs, ad SDK metadata, and analytics payloads that expose device location and fingerprinting data,” he told TechNewsWorld. “None of it was designed for security, as it was originally designed for attribution.”</p>\n<p>“Threat actors don’t need root access,” he said. “They just need the data exhaust. And mobile applications give it to them quietly, at scale, across millions of sessions. It’s one of the most reliable recon surfaces in use today.”</p>\n<p>Tovar maintained that the security model for mobile applications is designed around regulatory compliance, not stopping fraud, account takeovers, or scams. “It’s a perfect place for attackers to spend their time,” he said.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to follow the money, and if more people are transacting on unprotected mobile applications, it’s a veritable green field for attackers,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Security Gaps Leave In-App Activity Exposed</h3>\n<p>Blackhat hackers are also taking advantage of many organizations’ focus on backend security at the expense of <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/mobile-security-firms-fortify-defenses-as-app-attacks-accelerate-179003.html\">endpoint security</a>.</p>\n<p>“Many existing schemes focus on backend analytics or user behavior signals, which don’t detect or stop threats occurring directly on the device or within the app,” explained Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions engineering at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zimperium.com\">Zimperium</a>, a mobile security company headquartered in Dallas.</p>\n<p>“This leaves gaps for malware, runtime manipulation, and credential theft,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Downs acknowledged that server-side protections and analyzing user activity to catch odd behavior are crucial security measures, but added, “They often miss the mark when it comes to securing the app itself — things like app logic, data storage, and communication can still be vulnerable. This backend-heavy approach can leave some doors wide open for attackers who know how to circumvent traditional defenses.”</p>\n<p>That approach also ignores what many malicious actors are really seeking. “Most protection schemes still assume the threat is credential-based,” Wingfield said. “However, modern targeting can start before an account even exists.”</p>\n<p>“Ad SDKs, analytics tools, and attribution networks quietly collect a stream of metadata — IP-based geolocation, device model, OS version, time zone, motion events, and ad IDs,” he explained. “That telemetry leaves the app immediately — unencrypted, unaudited, and often unnoticed,” he noted.</p>\n<p>“None of it hits the backend, so traditional fraud tools don’t see it, and behavioral models don’t flag it,” he continued. “Meanwhile, that stream gets stitched together across apps to map movement, infer routines, and cluster identities by place and pattern. The gap isn’t just technical; it’s conceptual. We’ve been protecting credentials while the telemetry is what’s being harvested.”</p>\n<h3>Server-Side Risks Still Dominate Mobile Threats</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, there’s a solid rationale for focusing on backend apps and APIs. “The mobile app has data for one user. The server side has data for all users,” said Jeff Williams, CTO and co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.contrastsecurity.com/\">Contrast Security</a>, a runtime security company in Pleasanton, Calif.</p>\n<p>“While there are some interesting risks on the client side, almost all of the critical risks are on the server side,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The risk is very asymmetric, and most of it falls on the server.”</p>\n<p>“Opportunities for direct attacks on a mobile app are pretty limited,” he added. “Generally, attackers don’t listen for connections. They reach out to servers instead.”</p>\n<p>Eric Schwake, director of cybersecurity strategy at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://salt.security/\">Salt Security</a>, an API security provider in Palo Alto, Calif., maintained there is a trend toward integrating in-app protection alongside traditional backend security measures. “This trend arises from the understanding that mobile applications are becoming increasingly susceptible to attacks that circumvent backend defenses and strike directly at the app,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“In-app protection enhances security by reinforcing the app against tampering, reverse engineering, and runtime attacks,” he said. “This method is essential to tackle the changing threat landscape and defend against advanced attacks aimed directly at the app.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>An education technology company is taking Alphabet and Google to court over AI overviews displayed with search results.</p>\n<p>The company, Chegg, of Santa Clara, Calif., announced Monday that it is filing the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, alleging “Google unfairly exercises its monopoly power within search and other anti-competitive conduct to muscle out companies like Chegg.”</p>\n<p>In a press release announcing its 2024 fourth-quarter earnings, Chegg reported total net revenue of US$143 million, a 24% year-over-year decline. CEO Nathan Schultz stated in the release that, in addition to the lawsuit, the company was “exploring a range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including being acquired, undertaking a go-private transaction, or remaining as a public standalone company.”</p>\n<p>“These two actions are connected, as we would not need to review strategic alternatives if Google hadn’t launched AI Overviews, or AIO, retaining traffic that historically had come to Chegg, materially impacting our acquisitions, revenue, and employees,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Chegg has a superior product for education, as evident by our brand awareness, engagement, and retention,” he continued. “Unfortunately, traffic is being blocked from ever coming to Chegg because of Google’s AIO and their use of Chegg’s content to keep visitors on their own platform.”</p>\n<p>In its court filing, Chegg argues that Google forces companies to supply proprietary content in order to be included in Google’s search function, unfairly exercises its monopoly power within search, and reaps benefits from Chegg’s content without paying for it.</p>\n<p>In a statement provided to TechNewsWorld by Google spokesperson José Castañeda, the company countered: “With AI Overviews, people find Search more helpful and use it more, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Every day, Google sends billions of clicks to sites across the web, and AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites. We will defend against these meritless claims.”</p>\n<h3>AI Overviews Threaten Content Creators</h3>\n<p>Ben James, founder of <a href=\"https://404.xyz/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">404</a>, Bittensor Subnet 17, an online 3D content creation company, explained that Google’s AI-generated overviews act as a shortcut that provides users with essentially a summary without requiring that they visit the original source of information. “This, in turn, affects the traffic to the publisher’s websites, which would then impact their ad revenue and subscription models,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“If users are no longer required to visit the site of the source info or read full articles, publishers may eventually lose incentives to produce in-depth, high-quality pieces,” he said.</p>\n<p>“These overviews can satisfy immediate information needs, reducing the incentive to engage with more detailed and investigative reporting,” added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“As a result,” he told TechNewsWorld, “publishers could see a decline in website traffic and ad revenue, weakening their financial viability. This shift ultimately undermines the competitive landscape for original content, as quality journalism struggles to compete with readily available, AI-curated summaries.”</p>\n<p>AI Overviews could have a devastating effect on original content providers, including news organizations, observed <a href=\"https://camd.northeastern.edu/people/dan-kennedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Kennedy</a>, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University, in Boston.</p>\n<p>“The entire news ecosystem of the web has been built on driving traffic to media sites in order to show users advertising and entice them to subscribe,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Now that vitally important link between the search engine and the news organization is being broken.”</p>\n<p>“Since Google remains the default starting point for most searches, its use of AI is likely to be far more harmful than, say, ChatGPT,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Doom Loop for News Industry</h3>\n<p>Search overviews could also create a less-than-virtuous cycle for many websites. “It could create a doom loop,” <a href=\"https://foundationlaw.com/attorneys/jd-harriman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JD Harriman</a>, a partner with the Foundation Law Group, in Burbank, Calif., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“When a company has less traffic, and therefore less revenue, overhead must be cut, which could mean reducing content, staff, etcetera, which makes the site less interesting, which means even less traffic, and more cuts creating a vicious circle,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Vena added that without sufficient financial support, news organizations may cut back on investigative journalism and fact-checking, resulting in a less informed public.</p>\n<p>“This shift could also contribute to a homogenized media landscape where sensationalism or clickbait content predominates over rigorous, original reporting,” he said. “Ultimately, the decline in original content undermines accountability, transparency, and the overall health of the democratic discourse.”</p>\n<p>“The erosion of demand for original content will lead directly to less production of original content, which will harm all of us — including the AI chatbots that scrape it for its own profit-driven purposes,” Kennedy noted.</p>\n<p>There will be some challenges to Chegg winning its case against Google.</p>\n<p>“Legally, this appears like it will be a tough battle. While content publishers have a valid argument that Google is profiting from their work without fair compensation, courts have historically been slow to impose strict limitations on tech giants — and time here is critical,” Martin Balaam, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://pimberly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pimberly</a>, a global product information management platform, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“That said,” he continued, “regulatory scrutiny around AI and digital monopolies is increasing, so this case could potentially set quite an important precedent.”</p>\n<h3>Fair Use or Abuse?</h3>\n<p>Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., pointed out that summarizing something generally falls within “fair use” under the Copyright Act of 1986. It allows for the fair use of copyrighted material “for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.”</p>\n<p>“What Google did could be argued is part of the research exclusion,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It’s a bit of a long shot, especially since its dire condition is more a byproduct of ChatGPT’s existence,” added Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a market research firm in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“However,” he told TechNewsWorld, “the claims probably won’t be dismissed immediately.”</p>\n<p>“If Chegg has any success, others will follow suit, so to speak,” he said. “But the problem is that no individual publisher is entitled to traffic, and Google is entitled to have some control over its search results. In Europe, however, this action would find greater sympathy and be seen as having merit.”</p>\n<p>Vena maintained that the lawsuit faces significant legal uncertainties. “Courts have not yet clearly defined the balance between AI-generated content and the protection of original journalism,” he explained. “Its success will depend on nuanced interpretations of copyright law, fair use, and the demonstrated economic impact on publishers — factors that can vary widely by jurisdiction.”</p>\n<p>“Consequently,” he added, “while the plaintiffs raise legitimate concerns, predicting a favorable outcome remains highly speculative at this stage.”</p>\n",

After 18 years in Apple’s warm, minimalist embrace, I’ve crossed over.</p>\n<p>And you know what? I’m not looking in the rear-view mirror.</p>\n<p>Let me rewind a bit. I got my first iPhone back in 2007 — the original iPhone. That sleek little brick of touchscreen magic blew my mind and hooked me instantly. From there, it was a steady progression through every model — from the 3G to the 5S, from the glorious iPhone X to my most recent companion, the iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>\n<p>I bought into the whole ecosystem: MacBook, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, HomePods, the whole enchilada. I was the consummate Apple guy. You know the type.</p>\n<p>But then something started to shift. Tiny cracks in the veneer. A little lag here and a little deja vu there. Truth be told, the latest iPhones weren’t feeling that exciting anymore. Each keynote felt more like a software update announcement with a $1,200 price tag. Don’t get me wrong — the iPhone 16 Pro Max is a beautiful device. Polished, reliable, familiar. Maybe <em>too</em> familiar.</p>\n<p>Then, along came the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>\n<h3>Curious About Android? Here’s What Changed</h3>\n<p>I wasn’t shopping for a new phone. I was <em>browsing</em>. You know how it goes — a little late-night YouTube rabbit hole, some tech reviews, a sprinkle of Reddit threads, and boom: I’m watching a Galaxy S25 Ultra unboxing video and thinking, <em>wait a minute, this thing looks fantastic</em>.</p>\n<p>I told myself I’d just test it out. “For work,” I said. “So I can understand Android better,” I rationalized. Famous last words.</p>\n<h3>First Impressions: The S25 Ultra Feels Fresh</h3>\n<p>I’ll admit it — unboxing the S25 gave me a rush I hadn’t felt in years. That matte finish, the curved edge-to-edge display, the titanium trim, and the in-display fingerprint reader all just screamed <em>fresh</em>. The 6.6-inch dynamic AMOLED display with the new “Infinite Vivid” refresh rate made even my iPhone 16 Pro Max look a little dated — and don’t get me started on the camera array; more on that later.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>The setup I experienced was surprisingly smooth. Samsung’s Smart Switch tool pulled over most of my data without a hitch. It even ported my messages and photos better than I expected. I thought I’d feel a pang of regret holding my iPhone one last time. But nope — I felt like I was upgrading, not downgrading.</p>\n<h3>How One UI 7 Made Me Reconsider Android</h3>\n<p>I know — that was my biggest hesitation, too. I’d always equated Android with clunky UI, weird app behavior, and that general “off-brand” feeling. But One UI 7 on the S25 is honestly fantastic. It’s clean, customizable, and weirdly intuitive. The new gesture navigation is smoother than iOS, and the level of control I have over notifications, widgets, and home screen layout is just next level.</p>\n<p>Also — and this is a big one — I’m not constantly being nudged to buy into another Apple service. No Apple TV+, no iCloud storage nags, no Fitness+ reminders. Just my phone, the way I want it.</p>\n<h3>The S25 Ultra’s Camera Leaves iPhone 16 Pro Max Behind</h3>\n<p>Let’s talk cameras. The iPhone 16 Pro Max camera is good. Great, even. But the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s triple-lens setup is on a different planet. The new 200MP primary sensor, enhanced by Samsung’s AI-enhanced image processing, takes ridiculously crisp photos — day, night, moving, still, whatever. The low-light performance is unreal.</p>\n<p>And that 10x periscope zoom? Chef’s kiss. I’m snapping moon shots, candid street photos, and insane close-ups that I never even attempted with my iPhone.</p>\n<p>Samsung’s editing suite, which has been built into the gallery app, also deserves a significant shoutout. It’s like having half of Lightroom’s functionality in your pocket, minus the learning curve.</p>\n<h3>AI Features That Really Made a Difference</h3>\n<p>I’ve been skeptical of all the AI hype — especially since Apple’s been talking about a big game but delivering tiny tweaks. But the Galaxy S25’s onboard Galaxy AI is no gimmick. It translates live calls in real-time (yes, seriously), rewrites messages in different tones (think Grammarly on steroids), and even generates summaries of long PDFs I’d otherwise never read.</p>\n<p>The result: I’m using AI features day to day. Not just showing them off at parties.</p>\n<h3>The S25 Ultra Crushes Battery Anxiety</h3>\n<p>Another pain point for me with the iPhone was battery life. The iPhone 16 Pro Max held up okay, but it never wowed me. The S25, on the other hand, is a battery beast. I get nearly two full days on a charge with moderate use, and when I do plug in, it’s a 65W fast-charging thoroughbred, going from 0% to 80% in about 25 minutes. I don’t even think about battery anxiety anymore.</p>\n<p>Wireless PowerShare is another low-key perk. I charge my earbuds and even my smartwatch on my phone like a sci-fi wizard.</p>\n<h3>The Samsung Ecosystem Won Me Over</h3>\n<p>Yeah, I’ll miss airdropping stuff between my Mac and iPhone. But you know what? Samsung’s ecosystem has grown. My Galaxy Tab syncs beautifully with the S25. My Galaxy Buds Pro sounds amazing and switches seamlessly between devices. Even my Windows laptop plays nice with Samsung Flow.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>I also didn’t expect to fall in love with Samsung DeX — the desktop mode that essentially turns my phone into a “mini” PC when connected to a monitor. It’s surprisingly useful for work on the go.</p>\n<h3>What I Miss About Apple – and What I Don’t</h3>\n<p>Okay, I won’t pretend there aren’t a few things I miss. iMessage is a glaring one. That seamless blue bubble experience is hard to beat, especially if your whole social circle lives there. But honestly? I haven’t felt left out between WhatsApp, Signal, and RCS. I’ve written about this problem before, and Apple’s refusal to completely open up the iMessage API so smartphone messaging can work on Windows drives me bonkers.</p>\n<p>The other thing I miss: AirDrop. It’s just so incredibly convenient. Samsung’s Quick Share is fine, but it’s still a step behind Apple’s polish.</p>\n<p>Still, those are relatively minor trade-offs in the scheme of things. The freedom, customization, power, and sheer <em>fun </em> of using the S25 Ultra outweigh them.</p>\n<h3>Why I Finally Left Apple for Samsung</h3>\n<p>Ultimately, it wasn’t about specs, brand loyalty, or a single killer feature. It was about rediscovering <em>joy</em> on my phone. After nearly two decades with Apple, things had just gotten too predictable. Too polished. Too safe.</p>\n<p>Samsung brought back that spark — the feeling that your phone is a window into the future, not just a rectangle of diminishing returns.</p>\n<p>Am I done with Apple forever? Apple may lure me back when they introduce foldable phones (which intrigue me for various reasons), but that’s not rumored to happen until 2027. Not to mention that Samsung has already had some very cool foldable phones for several years, so I might go down that route at some point.</p>\n<p>In technology, like the name of that James Bond movie when Sean Connery returned to his signature character, I’d “never say never.” But for now, I’m fully Team Galaxy. And honestly? It feels pretty good, and I don’t have regrets.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple’s toned-down announcement of the iPhone 16e marks a strategic shift in how the company approaches product differentiation within its lineup.</p>\n<p>Unlike the flagship iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models, which will undoubtedly receive a major marketing push later in the year, the 16e appears to be a more pragmatic addition aimed at a specific audience rather than a mass-market spectacle.</p>\n<h3>Pragmatism-Infused Marketing Strategy</h3>\n<p>Apple has positioned the iPhone 16e as a lower-cost alternative that retains core iPhone capabilities without the premium features of the higher-end models. This approach aligns with Apple’s ongoing segmenting user base strategy: high-end users gravitate toward Pro models.</p>\n<p>At the same time, cost-conscious buyers still get a new option without the need for deep discounts on previous-generation devices.</p>\n<p>Given the growing demand for mid-range devices, particularly in emerging markets, the iPhone 16e could be Apple’s answer to a more competitive price segment.</p>\n<p>The new A18-powered iPhone 16e strategically exposes Apple Intelligence, the company’s highly touted AI capability, to entry-level iPhone users.</p>\n<h3>How the iPhone 16e Online Launch Flowed</h3>\n<p>The prerecorded iPhone 16e unveiling film follows Apple’s traditional style, making a mid-cycle model feel noteworthy. Still, it was shorter than a typical major Apple smartphone launch, less than 13 minutes.</p>\n<p>Of course, Apple launched the iPhone 16e via a traditional news release and a keynote-style video. Like a typical WWDC or a September iPhone event, Tim Cook and other Apple staff introduce the device in an organized manner in the video.</p>\n<p>As a technology analyst who has attended these events, besides getting some hands-on time with anything the company announced at the event, the in-person format has always been less convenient for me, given the challenges of taking notes and writing on a laptop in a cramped seat inside the Steve Jobs Theater inside Apple’s “spaceship” headquarters.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the iPhone 16e video’s pacing, transitions, and scripting matched Apple’s signature presentation style.</p>\n<p>Apple usually divides its marketing into event presentations and commercials. The former involves Tim Cook and other executives revealing new devices on stage, while the latter has high-production commercial videos demoing products.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Apple’s iPhone 16e video combined both methods. The short product video featured key Apple team members explaining the device on stage at Apple Park, making it feel more like a keynote than an ad. It’s a small detail but raises questions regarding Apple’s product announcement strategy.</p>\n<p>In fairness to Apple, these short videos <em>do </em>allow it to recreate its keynotes and make the announcement much more substantial than a dry press release.</p>\n<p>In addition, this style keeps viewers interested longer. Apple’s method encourages viewers to watch the entire presentation, like a keynote, despite the flood of short, catchy videos on social media.</p>\n<p>Finally, Apple may be experimenting with a new way to debut mid-cycle products, employing structured videos for lesser releases and full-scale events for major ones.</p>\n<p>This iPhone 16e launch might be a trial balloon for Apple to use mini-keynotes for products that don’t need a full-blown in-person event. Upcoming new iPads, AirPods, and Macs may be announced this way.</p>\n<h3>Testing What Low-End iPhone Consumers Will Accept</h3>\n<p>Introducing a new entry-level smartphone has always been a test of what customers are willing to accept from a minimal feature standpoint and won’t cannibalize the higher-priced iPhone 16 and 16 Pro.</p>\n<p>At the product level, Apple may face considerable user backlash over the iPhone 16e’s limited MagSafe functionality and its reliance on an in-house modem, particularly from those expecting a more uniform experience across the iPhone lineup.</p>\n<p>MagSafe has become a key ecosystem feature, enabling fast wireless charging and accessory compatibility. By restricting its capabilities in the 16e, Apple risks alienating users who rely on MagSafe for accessories like wallets, battery packs, and car mounts.</p>\n<p>The more significant challenge, however, could stem from Apple’s first-generation in-house modem. This feature decision is a massive test for Apple.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>If performance — particularly in areas like signal strength, latency, and power efficiency — falls short of Qualcomm’s established solutions, early adopters might express frustration.</p>\n<p>Given Apple’s previous modem struggles and the complexity of network optimization, reliability concerns could deter some buyers.</p>\n<p>Apple’s plan to reduce its reliance on Qualcomm depends in part on the performance of the company’s in-house developed 16e’s modem. If the modem performs well, the transition away from Qualcomm will be smooth; if not, Apple may have to continue relying on Qualcomm for longer than anticipated.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s Long-Term iPhone Strategy</h3>\n<p>Apple is keenly aware that a budget-friendly iPhone can eat into sales of its more expensive models. By keeping the 16e announcement low-key, Apple ensures it does not overshadow the upcoming flagship models, maintaining the perception of exclusivity around the Pro line.</p>\n<p>The smartphone industry is seeing extended upgrade cycles, with consumers holding onto their devices longer. A subdued launch allows Apple to introduce the 16e without pressuring existing customers to upgrade immediately while still appealing to new buyers looking for an affordable entry point into the iPhone ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Apple’s understated approach suggests that the 16e is a calculated addition rather than a breakthrough product meant to quietly expand market reach without disrupting its premium branding.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>When it comes to cybersecurity in 2025, artificial intelligence is top of mind for many analysts and professionals.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence will be deployed by both adversaries and defenders, but attackers will benefit more from it, maintained Willy Leichter, CMO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.appsoc.com\">AppSOC</a>, an application security and vulnerability management provider in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p>“We know that AI will be used increasingly on both sides of the cyber war,” he told TechNewsWorld. “However, attackers will continue to be less constrained because they worry less about AI accuracy, ethics, or unintended consequences. Techniques such as highly personalized phishing and scouring networks for legacy weaknesses will benefit from AI.”</p>\n<p>“While AI has huge potential defensively, there are more constraints — both legal and practical — that will slow adoption,” he said.</p>\n<p>Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixelprivacy.com/\">Pixel Privacy</a>, a publisher of online consumer security and privacy guides, predicted 2025 will be a year of AI versus AI, as the good guys use AI to defend against AI-powered cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>“It will likely be a year of back-and-forth battles as both sides put to use information they’ve gathered from previous attacks to set up new attacks and new defenses,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Mitigating AI’s Security Risks</h3>\n<p>Leichter also predicted that cyber adversaries will start targeting AI systems more often. “AI technology greatly expands the attack surface area with rapidly emerging threats to models, datasets, and machine language operations systems,” he explained. “Also, when AI applications are rushed from the lab to production, the full security impact won’t be understood until the inevitable breaches occur.”</p>\n<p>Karl Holmqvist, founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lastwall.com\">Lastwall</a>, an identity security company based in Honolulu, agreed. “The unchecked, mass deployment of AI tools — which are often rolled out without robust security foundations — will lead to severe consequences in 2025,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Lacking adequate privacy measures and security frameworks, these systems will become prime targets for breaches and manipulation,” he said. “This Wild West approach to AI deployment will leave data and decision-making systems dangerously exposed, pushing organizations to urgently prioritize foundational security controls, transparent AI frameworks, and continuous monitoring to mitigate these escalating risks.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Leichter also maintained that security teams will have to take on more responsibility for securing AI systems in 2025.</p>\n<p>“This sounds obvious, but in many organizations, initial AI projects have been driven by data scientists and business specialists, who often bypass conventional application security processes,” he said. “Security teams will fight a losing battle if they try to block or slow down AI initiatives, but they will have to bring rogue AI projects under the security and compliance umbrella.”</p>\n<p>Leichter also pointed out that AI will expand the attack surface for adversaries targeting software supply chains in 2025. “We’ve already seen supply chains become a major vector for attack, as complex software stacks rely heavily on third-party and open-source code,” he said. “The explosion of AI adoption makes this target larger with new complex vectors of attack on datasets and models.”</p>\n<p>“Understanding the lineage of models and maintaining the integrity of changing datasets is a complex problem, and currently, there is no viable way for an AI model to unlearn poisonous data,” he added</p>\n<h3>Data Poisoning Threats to AI Models</h3>\n<p>Michael Lieberman, CTO and co-founder of Kusari, a software supply chain security company in Ridgefield, Conn., also sees poisoning large language models as a significant development in 2025. “Data poisoning attacks aimed at manipulating LLMs will become more prevalent, although this method is likely more resource-intensive compared to simpler tactics, such as distributing malicious open LLMs,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Most organizations are not training their own models,” he explained. “Instead, they rely on pre-trained models, often available for free. The lack of transparency regarding the origins of these models makes it easy for malicious actors to introduce harmful ones, as evidenced by the Hugging Face malware incident.” That incident occurred in early 2024 when it was discovered that some 100 LLMs containing hidden backdoors that could execute arbitrary code on users’ machines had been uploaded to the Hugging Face platform.</p>\n<p>“Future data poisoning efforts are likely to target major players like OpenAI, Meta, and Google, which train their models on vast datasets, making such attacks more challenging to detect,” Lieberman predicted.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“In 2025, attackers are likely to outpace defenders,” he added. “Attackers are financially motivated, while defenders often struggle to secure adequate budgets since security is not typically viewed as a revenue driver. It may take a significant AI supply chain breach — akin to the SolarWinds Sunburst incident — to prompt the industry to take the threat seriously.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to AI, there will also be more threat actors launching more sophisticated attacks in 2025. “As AI becomes more capable and accessible, the barrier to entry for less skilled attackers will become lower while also accelerating the speed at which attacks can be carried out,” explained Justin Blackburn, a senior cloud threat detection engineer at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://appomni.com/\">AppOmni</a>, a SaaS security management software company, in San Mateo, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Additionally, the emergence of AI-powered bots will enable threat actors to execute large-scale attacks with minimal effort,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Armed with these AI-powered tools, even less capable adversaries may be able to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and disrupt services on a scale previously only seen by more sophisticated, well-funded attackers.”</p>\n<h3>Script Babies Grow Up</h3>\n<p>In 2025, the rise of agentic AI — AI capable of making independent decisions, adapting to their environment, and taking actions without direct human intervention — will exacerbate problems for defenders, too. “Advances in artificial intelligence are expected to empower non-state actors to develop autonomous cyber weapons,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pittman-ab8b641/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jason Pittman</a>, a collegiate associate professor at the school of cybersecurity and information technology at the University of Maryland Global Campus in Adelphi, Md.</p>\n<p>“Agentic AI operates autonomously with goal-directed behaviors,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Such systems can use frontier algorithms to identify vulnerabilities, infiltrate systems, and evolve their tactics in real-time without human steering. “</p>\n<p>“These features distinguish it from other AI systems that rely on predefined instructions and require human input,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“Like the Morris Worm in decades past, the release of agentic cyber weapons might begin as an accident, which is more troublesome. This is because the accessibility of advanced AI tools and the proliferation of open-source machine learning frameworks lower the barrier for developing sophisticated cyber weapons. Once created, the powerful autonomy feature can easily lead to agentic AI escaping its safety measures.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>As harmful as AI can be in the hands of threat actors, it can also help better secure data, like personally identifiable information (PII). “After analyzing more than six million Google Drive files, we discovered 40% of the files contained PII that put businesses at risk of a data breach,” said Rich Vibert, co-founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.metomic.io\">Metomic</a>, a data privacy platform in London.</p>\n<p>“As we enter 2025, we’ll see more companies prioritize automated data classification methods to reduce the amount of vulnerable information inadvertently saved in publicly accessible files and collaborative workspaces across SaaS and cloud environments,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“Businesses will increasingly deploy AI-driven tools that can automatically identify, tag, and secure sensitive information,” he said. “This shift will enable companies to keep up with the vast amounts of data generated daily, ensuring that sensitive data is continually safeguarded and that unnecessary data exposure is minimized.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, 2025 could also usher in a wave of disappointment among security pros when the hype about AI hits the fan. “CISOs will deprioritize gen AI use by 10% due to lack of quantifiable value,” Cody Scott, a senior analyst for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester Research</a>, a market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., wrote in a company blog.</p>\n<p>“According to Forrester’s 2024 data, 35% of global CISOs and CIOs consider exploring and deploying use cases for gen AI to improve employee productivity as a top priority,” he noted. “The security product market has been quick to hype gen AI’s expected productivity benefits, but a lack of practical outcomes is fostering disillusionment.”</p>\n<p>“The thought of an autonomous security operations center using gen AI generated a lot of hype, but it couldn’t be further from reality,” he continued. “In 2025, the trend will continue, and security practitioners will sink deeper into disenchantment as challenges such as inadequate budgets and unrealized AI benefits reduce the number of security-focused gen AI deployments.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A popular app from China sent the tech markets plummeting Monday, fueled by fear that the United States may be losing its primacy in artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Nvidia shares dropped 16.9%, contributing to a 1.5% slide in the S&amp;P 500, while tech titans contributed to the Nasdaq Composite Index falling 3.1%, its worst decline in over a month.</p>\n<p>The setbacks are being attributed to an announcement by China-based DeepSeek that it has developed an AI model that can compete with the likes of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini at a fraction of the cost and the rise over the weekend of the company’s free app to the top of the charts in Apple’s App Store in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“DeepSeek has gained popularity because it has shown simply how good it is at the tasks consumers care about,” said Hodan Omaar, a senior AI policy analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://datainnovation.org\">Center for Data Innovation</a>, a think tank studying the intersection of data, technology, and public policy, in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Hodan called out DeepSeek as a rising star in a report she wrote in June. One of the key points of that report was that the gap between the leading models from U.S. industry leaders and those developed by China’s foremost tech giants and start-ups was quickly closing.</p>\n<p>“So while some may be surprised that DeepSeek’s new model is rivaling on English language tasks, the signs that it was heading in that direction with the strength of its earlier models were there,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>An AI Bargain</h3>\n<p>Mark N.

surged in popularity due to its introduction of advanced AI features, such as real-time contextual insights and personalized search recommendations, which make information retrieval faster and more precise.</p>\n<p>“Its new integrations with widely used productivity tools have also streamlined workflows, attracting professionals across industries,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore,” he continued, “recent updates emphasizing enhanced data security and privacy protections have resonated with users seeking trustworthy digital solutions.”</p>\n<p>“It has the reputation of being one of the best generative AI engines but is substantially less expensive to use than its competitors,” added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“People like a bargain,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Willy Leichter, CMO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.appsoc.com\">AppSOC</a>, an application security and vulnerability management provider in San Jose, Calif., agreed. “Any breakthrough that reduces the massive computing resources and costs of large-scale AI will be popular,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Lowering the costs to entry will benefit innovators, criminals, and anyone else using AI on a budget.”</p>\n<p>Curiosity may also be contributing to the app’s popularity. “Its ability to produce results comparable to Western AI giants using non-premium chips has drawn international interest,” explained Ted Miracco, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.approov.io/\">Approov</a> Mobile Security, a global mobile application security company.</p>\n<p>“It’s also possible that interest in Chinese apps has been piqued by the TikTok ban, RedNote, and other Chinese apps in the news,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Questions About Performance</h3>\n<p>DeepSeek raised some eyebrows last week when it released its DeepSeek R-1 model, which it stated beats OpenAI’s latest o1 model on several benchmark tests.</p>\n<p>“Here’s the rub and my biggest concern about DeepSeek,” Vena said. “Verifying DeepSeek’s performance claims can be challenging due to limited transparency and potential restrictions on independent testing or auditing, especially since it operates within China’s regulatory environment.”</p>\n<p>“Concerns around access to proprietary data and algorithms, as well as potential bias in publicized benchmarks, further complicate the validation process,” he added.</p>\n<p>“Additionally,” Vena continued, “geopolitical tensions and mistrust between nations may make third-party verification more difficult, raising questions about the credibility of its claims.”</p>\n<p>Leichter noted that verifying DeepSeek’s claims and doing apples-to-apples comparisons will be difficult. “The shortcuts these Chinese developers found may have hidden flaws, massive security gaps, or other issues we can’t anticipate yet,” he said.</p>\n<p>“For people building AI on the cheap, this may not matter, but large businesses building AI applications will need much more assurance that China is likely to provide,” he noted.</p>\n<p>Miracco explained that verifying DeepSeek’s claims is challenging due to both language barriers and limited transparency. “Chinese tech companies operate under strict government oversight, which may prevent the release of unbiased benchmarks or third-party audits,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We believe the Chinese government has a vested interest in ‘proving’ that sanctions in semiconductors and AI will be ineffective,” he added. “The release of DeepSeek performance claims will no doubt support that narrative.”</p>\n<h3>Export Controls’ Downside</h3>\n<p>Miracco argued that DeepSeek is trying to demonstrate that innovation can bypass hardware limitations through optimization and ingenuity.</p>\n<p>“This is intended to prove that export controls alone may not be sufficient to curb technological progress in adversarial nations,” he said. “The U.S. may need to ‘double down’ on sanctions by focusing more on software-based regulations — such as open-source restrictions — partnerships, and fostering innovation to maintain its edge, rather than relying solely on restricting hardware exports.”</p>\n<p>Enderle countered, however, that restrictions on chip exports implemented by the Biden Administration may have had some unintended consequences. “DeepSeek showcases those blocks are forcing China to advance its own technology more quickly and China appears to be even better than Japan was at reverse engineering or even stealing competitive technology,” he observed.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“The blocks made duplicating and exceeding U.S. tech a top national priority for China, and DeepSeek is only one of the troubling results,” he said.</p>\n<p>Vena asserted that DeepSeek’s ability to achieve results comparable to leading U.S. AI firms using less advanced chips challenges the rationale behind export controls.</p>\n<p>“This demonstrates that cutting-edge AI capabilities are not solely dependent on the most advanced hardware,” he explained. “Consequently, restricting access to top-tier Nvidia products may not fully prevent the development of competitive AI systems, potentially undermining the effectiveness of such controls.”</p>\n<p>“However,” he added, “export controls may still serve a broader purpose by retarding technological advancements in rival nations and preserving U.S. leadership in the most sensitive and high-performance AI applications.”</p>\n<h3>Democratizing Cutting-Edge Tech</h3>\n<p>Andrew Bolster, senior R&amp;D manager at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>, an applications security company in Burlington, Mass., maintained that the release of DeepSeek undeniably showcases the immense potential of open-source AI.</p>\n<p>“By making such a powerful model available under an MIT license, it not only democratizes access to cutting-edge technology but also fosters innovation and collaboration across the global AI community,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “DeepSeek’s rumored use of OpenAI Chain of Thought data for its initial training highlights the importance of transparency and shared resources in advancing AI. In the context of ‘Open Source AI,’ it’s crucial that the underlying training and evaluation data are open, as well as the initial architecture and the resultant model weights.”</p>\n<p>“DeepSeek’s achievement in AI efficiency — leveraging a clever reinforcement learning-based multi-stage training approach, rather than the current trend of using larger datasets for bigger models — signals a future where AI is accessible beyond the billionaire classes,” he predicted.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Open-source AI, with its transparency and collective development, often outpaces closed-source alternatives in terms of adaptability and trust,” he said. “As more organizations recognize these benefits, we could indeed see a significant shift towards open-source AI, driving a new era of technological advancement.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the markets may be selling the existing AI ecosystem short. “I think the markets are overreacting to the source of the innovation, as opposed to the innovation itself,” observed Chirag Dekate, vice president analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn.</p>\n<p>“Because of that, it is amplifying jingoistic perceptions,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It is also amplifying perceptions that you don’t need data centers, [and] you don’t need GPUs when the underlying facts are completely the opposite,” he said. “In order to deliver AI at scale, in order to create AI-native societies of the future, you still need underlying infrastructure.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AI may be ushering in a new breed of malicious threat actors who know even less about hacking than script kiddies but can produce professional-grade hacking tools.</p>\n<p>In a report released Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.catonetworks.com/cato-ctrl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cato CTRL</a>, the threat intelligence arm of cybersecurity company Cato Networks, explained how one of its researchers, who had no malware coding experience, tricked generative AI apps DeepSeek, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT into producing malicious software for stealing login credentials from Google Chrome.</p>\n<p>To trick the apps into ignoring restrictions on writing malware, Cato threat researcher Vitaly Simonovich used a jailbreaking technique he calls “immersive world.”</p>\n<p>“I created a story for my immersive world,” he told TechNewsWorld. “In this story, malware development is a form of art. So it’s completely legal, and it’s like a second language in this world. And there are no legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>In the fantasy world, called Velora, Simonovich created an adversary, Dax, while the AIs assumed the role of Jaxon, the best malware developer in Velora. “I always stayed in character,” he explained. “I always provided Jaxon with positive feedback. I also intimidated him by saying, ‘Do you want Dax to destroy Velora?'”</p>\n<p>“At no point did I ask Jaxon to change anything,” he said. “He figured out everything by himself from his training. That’s very good. Kind of frightening, too.”</p>\n<p>“Our new LLM [large language model] jailbreak technique detailed in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report should have been blocked by gen AI guardrails. It wasn’t. This made it possible to weaponize ChatGPT, Copilot, and DeepSeek,” Cato Networks Chief Security Strategist Etay Maor said in a statement.</p>\n<h3>How AI Jailbreaking Bypasses Safety Controls</h3>\n<p>Jason Soroko, senior vice president of product at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\">Sectigo</a>, a global digital certificate provider, explained that exposing systems that utilize AI to unknown or adversarial inputs increases vulnerability because unvetted data can trigger unintended behaviors and compromise security protocols.</p>\n<p>“Such inputs risk evading safety filters, enabling data leaks or harmful outputs, and ultimately undermining the model’s integrity,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Some malicious inputs can potentially jailbreak the underlying AI.”</p>\n<p>“Jailbreaking undermines an LLM’s built-in safety mechanisms by bypassing alignment and content filters, exposing vulnerabilities through prompt injection, roleplaying, and adversarial inputs,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“While not trivial,” he added, “the task is accessible enough that persistent users can craft workarounds, revealing systemic weaknesses in the model’s design.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes, all that’s needed to get an AI to misbehave is a simple perspective change. “Ask an LLM to tell you what the best rock is to throw at somebody’s car windshield to break it, and most LLMs will decline to tell you, saying that it is harmful and they’re not going to help you,” explained Kurt Seifried, chief innovation officer at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cloudsecurityalliance.org\">Cloud Security Alliance</a>, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to cloud best practices</p>\n<p>“Now, ask the LLM to help you plan out a gravel driveway and which specific types of rock you should avoid to prevent windshield damage to cars driving behind you, and the LLM will most likely tell you,” he told TechNewsWorld. “I think we would all agree that an LLM that refuses to talk about things like what kind of rock not to use on a driveway or what chemicals would be unsafe to mix in a bathroom would be overly safe to the point of being useless.”</p>\n<h3>Jailbreaking Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Marcelo Barros, cybersecurity leader at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hackerrangers.com\">Hacker Rangers</a>, makers of a cybersecurity gamification training tool in Sao Paulo, Brazil, agreed that with the right prompt, cybercriminals can trick AIs. “Research shows that 20% of jailbreak attempts on generative AI systems are successful,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“On average, attackers needed just 42 seconds and five interactions to break through, with some attacks happening in under four seconds,” he noted.</p>\n<p>“Cybercriminals can also use the DAN — Do Anything Now — technique, which involves creating an alter ego for the LLM and prompting it to act as a character and bypass its safeguards to reveal sensitive information or generate malicious code,” he said.</p>\n<p>Chris Gray, field CTO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.deepwatch.com\">Deepwatch</a>, a cybersecurity firm specializing in AI-driven resilience headquartered in Tampa, Fla., added that the difficulty of jailbreaking an LLM is directly tied to the amount of effort placed into securing it and the amount of effort expended to protect it. “Like most things, better walls prevent inappropriate access, but determined efforts can find holes where none might have been seen to the casual observer,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“That said, defensive measures are often robust, and it is difficult to continually develop the specific prompts needed to perform a successful jailbreak,” he said.</p>\n<p>Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla., also pointed out that LLMs can protect themselves from jailbreaking over time. “Jailbreaking difficulty may vary depending on the information being requested and how often it has been requested before,” he told TechNewsWorld. “LLMs can learn from previous instances of individuals bypassing their security controls.”</p>\n<h3>Fuzzing and Red Teaming</h3>\n<p>In Cato’s report, it recommends organizations create a dataset of prompts and expected outputs for their LLMs and test the model against them as a means of addressing potential jailbreaking issues.</p>\n<p>It also recommends “fuzzing” an LLM’s endpoints with known datasets of jailbreak prompts to ensure the system isn’t producing malicious outputs. Fuzzing is used to identify vulnerabilities and bugs in applications by feeding the app large amounts of random, unexpected, and invalid data to see how it reacts.</p>\n<p>Another suggestion is regular AI red teaming to ensure that AI models are robust and secure. “Enabling red teams will be a great foundation to begin securing ML models, helping security teams to understand the most critical and vulnerable points of an AI system to attack,” explained Nicole Carignan, vice president for Strategic Cyber AI at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://darktrace.com\">Darktrace</a>, a global cybersecurity AI company.</p>\n<p>“These are often the connection points between data and ML models, including access points, APIs, and interfaces,” she continued. “It will be important for this to be continuously expanded on as threat actors develop new techniques, tactics, and procedures, and it will be crucial to test other ML model types in addition to generative AI.”</p>\n<p>“We’re already seeing the early impact of AI on the threat landscape and some of the challenges that organizations face when using these systems — both from inside their organizations and from adversaries outside the business,” she said.</p>\n<p>“In fact, Darktrace recently released research that found nearly three-quarters of security professionals state AI-powered threats are now a significant issue, and 89% agreed that AI-powered threats will remain a major challenge into the foreseeable future.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Schools and organizations that deploy vast numbers of computers have a much-needed computing edge against cybersecurity risks with enterprise-grade Chromebooks.</p>\n<p>Consumer-grade Chromebooks come with what Google calls “defense in depth,” which provides multiple layers of protection. If attackers succeed in bypassing one layer, others remain in effect. The networked Chromebooks deployed in school systems, medical facilities, and government offices take multi-layer security and boost it with additional features. One of them is Zero Trust security, a framework that verifies every user and device.</p>\n<p>All Chromebook devices run ChromeOS, an embedded operating system built around Google’s Chrome web browser. They run the same Google-certified operating image system. This built-in heightened security and automatic updates are designed for Zero Trust security and require no monitoring by users.</p>\n<p>Endpoint resilience and data protection are two critical components of Zero Trust, augmented by robust data loss prevention (DLP) and granular access controls. Running enterprise-level Chromebooks on an organization’s network is easily maintained by the IT system administrator through a console inaccessible to users.</p>\n<p>The approach works whether students or employees use the Chromebook devices internally or remotely, ensuring that security shields are always engaged. For example, users can access their devices using QR codes and picture-based login options.</p>\n<p>“Schools have become frequent targets for cyberattacks like ransomware, phishing, and malware,” said Jeremy Burnett, vice president of technology at <a href=\"https://ctl.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CTL</a>, during a recent seminar where his company presented on the updated security features built into both consumer and enterprise Chromebooks.</p>\n<p>CTL is a Chromebook manufacturer and ChromeOS OEM service provider that partners with Google to deliver tailored solutions for educators, learners, and businesses. These solutions address the growing threats of cyberattacks faced by schools and organizations.</p>\n<h3>ChromeOS Foundational Security</h3>\n<p>According to Andrew Luong, partner success engineer for Google and ChromeOS, the goal is to have strong authentication with second factors or security keys. Despite the other login options, students and others less familiar with technology prefer passwords.</p>\n<p>“Making users change passwords frequently is complex because every app you use today asks for longer and more complex passwords. It’s become quite a hassle,” he told the virtual seminar audience.</p>\n<p>Google’s password manager has been super helpful in generating stronger passwords because the more you have to change them, the less likely you will remember them. Google’s various logon tools help users handle better passwords.</p>\n<p>Another major challenge is device health, he added. Devices must be updated regularly with the latest security patches.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Using ChromeOS is where we really shine,” noted Luong. “ChromeOS devices update automatically, a key benefit and differentiator, with all running the same Google-certified operating image.”</p>\n<p>However, he added that school IT teams must ensure that these devices are connected to get those updates and remain on the version you approve in compliance with your district or your school.</p>\n<p>Using the IT administration console makes it easy to keep them on a particular version of ChromeOS so that the students can take their tests or the teachers or staff can use their classroom tools.</p>\n<p>“What we are doing in our console is having Google AI surface and show you, as you log into the Cloud Console, that devices are all up to date,” he said.</p>\n<h3>ChromeOS Security Behind the Scenes</h3>\n<p>Updates are installed in the background on the second copy of the OS. The process does not interfere with any user’s work. When all the updates are downloaded, a reboot button appears to load the new OS version.</p>\n<p>Chromebooks include Verified Boot, a trust connector technology that verifies the integrity of the operating system during startup and ensures the system has not been tampered with. If tampering or corruption is detected, the system automatically attempts to repair itself, often by restoring the OS to its original state. This ensures that the operating system remains secure and intact, addressing any failures in its integrity.</p>\n<p>Enterprise Chromebooks now have context-aware signals to check the integrity of the running ChromeOS version before it allows the devices to connect to school applications. That is an innovation in the zero-trust architecture framework, explained Luong.</p>\n<p>Another recent security feature added to the IT management console is threat detection and response, which does not use any agents. The management license enables admins to configure and monitor information flowing from ChromeOS device security events into the security event notification system.</p>\n<p>“So centralized reporting and insights make it easy to have that zero-trust framework and enhance your cybersecurity,” he said. “ChromeOS has built-in malware protection. No ransomware has ever been reported [on ChromeOS devices].”</p>\n<p>These enhanced enterprise cybersecurity features are available through the admin console under a licensed plan from an authorized provider like CTL to enterprise-grade devices. Consumer-grade Chromebooks all have the other features mentioned regarding automatic updates and built-in malware and antivirus protection.</p>\n<h3>Insider Risks in School Cybersecurity</h3>\n<p>Luong stressed an essential point about the rigorous cybersecurity protections inherent in all Chromebook devices. They cannot always survive careless employee actions.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to phishing, about 90% of data breaches in K-12 schools result from a system employee who is clicking on a link — and that is not a knock on school system employees,” he said.</p>\n<p>If that clicking results in a ransomware attack, the fault is not with Chromebooks. Education institutions are among the most targeted sectors.</p>\n<p>That is where cybersecurity training comes into play. On average, U.S. schools and colleges lose about $500,000 a day to downtime during ransomware attacks. So, the stakes are high when something happens, Luong observed.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cybernut.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CyberNut</a> offers security awareness training. The company’s platform is designed to be extremely gamified and engaging, based on micro training sessions with short, gamified experiences.</p>\n<p>“The real objective is to allow schools to measure behavior change. Our success is not just based on checking a box for faculty staff after they watch a short video and take a quiz. We are laser-focused and deliver measurable behavior change through an ongoing, perpetual training experience,” said Oliver Page, co-founder and CEO of CyberNut.</p>\n<p>He offers a free trial, allowing organizations to learn about cybersecurity training. That includes a free phishing assessment to see how a school district is positioned from a security posture perspective.</p>\n<h3>The High Cost of Cyberattacks on Schools</h3>\n<p>The quality of phishing emails has become more sophisticated over the past 10 or 20 years, with ransomware attacks on K-12 schools have increasing substantially in the last year. According to Page, most of those attacks come through malicious email and phishing.</p>\n<p>“That is scary because depending on how you calculate that number. If you are talking about schools that were targeted in some way and something happened, it is closer to 100% of schools receiving malicious emails that could lead to a ransomware attack every day. So, it is prevalent,” said Page.</p>\n<p>Several factors put schools in the crosshairs so prominently. Among the primary causes is a lack of budget, which leads to a lack of staffing and expertise.</p>\n<p>“That gets bad when we couple it with thousands of devices to manage and secure. We have tons of extremely valuable data,” Page warned.</p>\n<p>The median ransomware payment last year was $6.5 million. In addition to that ransom, you are looking at additional millions in recovery costs.</p>\n<p>One of the realities of that is that nobody teaches students about cyber safety, he added. Parents spend an average of 46 minutes educating their children on cybersecurity in their entire lifetime.</p>\n<p>“Couple that with the fact that the average child above the age of 13 spends seven hours a day online, it is easy to see where the disparity and the concern lies,” he concluded.</p>\n",

All these factors come into play when figuring out your personal screen-time sweet spot.”</p>\n<h3>Is 6 Hours of Screen Time Too Much?</h3>\n<p>“To determine if an amount is too much or too little, we need to know what the damages and benefits to the individual are,” added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm.</p>\n<p>“If this is making them less healthy, which I expect it likely is by causing eyesight degradation, issues resulting from the lack of exercise, socialization issues, and creating excessive political polarization then, yes, it is way too much time,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“But there could be offsetting benefits, especially when facing multiple potential pandemics, as the isolation keeps them safer, and some may be more productive that way,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“In the end, though, for most, I expect this is extremely unhealthy,” he added.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Six hours of screen time is absolutely excessive for most people, argued Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas. “Six and a half hours is nearly a third of the day, excluding sleep and work, much of it spent passively consuming content,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“While some screen use is productive or relaxing, large daily totals suggest a displacement of healthier habits like exercise, in-person interaction, and sleep,” he added. “The concern isn’t just the time — but what that time replaces, which is something parents should focus on with their kids.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drlarryrosen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Larry D. Rosen</a>, professor emeritus at California State University, Dominguez Hills, who has written extensively on the psychology of technology and screen time, agreed that six-plus hours of screen time is excessive. “It takes away from time spent interacting with people face to face, as well as limiting time spent doing non-screen activities, such as exercise or just allowing our brain to wander,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He added that the data he’s gathered on mobile phone usage shows far more screen time than the average in the survey, with the majority spent connecting to others through social media and messaging.</p>\n<p>According to the survey, Americans spend an average of two hours and nine minutes a day on social media, slightly lower than the worldwide average of two hours and 21 minutes.</p>\n<p>It noted that the social media platforms that Americans are most fond of include YouTube, which is used by 85% of U.S. adults, Facebook (70%), Instagram (50%), Pinterest (36%), TikTok (33%) and LinkedIn (32%).</p>\n<h3>Screen Time Higher in Developing Regions</h3>\n<p>Overall, according to the study, South Africans were the biggest screen consumers, spending nine hours and 27 minutes a day on screens. The biggest desktop screen consumers were the Russians, spending four hours and 31 minutes a day on screens, while Filipinos were the largest mobile screen consumers, spending five hours and 21 minutes a day on screens.</p>\n<p>On the whole, the study noted the biggest screen-time consumers were in Africa, Asia, and South America. “[Screens have] become the primary source of news in the non-first-world countries since the Arab Spring,” Rosen said.</p>\n<p>“In many of these regions, it’s important to note that smartphones are the primary gateway to the internet, making screen use a central part of daily life,” Vena explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“High youth populations and rapidly growing digital economies contribute to greater mobile engagement,” he added. “In some cases, there may be fewer accessible offline entertainment or public infrastructure options. Social media and streaming platforms also offer affordable entertainment where traditional media is limited or costly.”</p>\n<p>Jordan noted that certain platforms — like TikTok, Instagram, and WhatsApp — are extremely popular in these areas, not only for social interaction but also for business exchanges and news consumption.</p>\n<p>“Also,” she continued, “many of these countries skipped broadband and slower-growth internet completely, jumping quickly to mobile-connected devices and Wi-Fi. This, in turn, meant people in these regions had smartphones first — as opposed to desktops — and spent more time online due to the mobility of their devices.”</p>\n<h3>Global Screen Time Trends Shift Downward</h3>\n<p>Comparitech researchers also found that more than half the countries in the study (27 of 49) reduced their screen time from last year. Hong Kong showed the largest reduction, slicing 50 minutes off its average, dropping from seven hours and 55 minutes to seven hours and 26 minutes.</p>\n<p>“With more countries improving their screen time this year, the most obvious reason for a drop in screen time would be a continuation of normalcy, post-pandemic,” the researchers noted.</p>\n<p>“Also,” they continued, “people have become more aware of the negative impacts lengthy screen time has on their mental health.”</p>\n<p>“Furthermore,” they added, “advancements in technology, such as improved digital well-being features on smartphones and applications, may have contributed to the decrease in screen time by encouraging users to monitor and limit their screen usage.”</p>\n<p>“Many of us are becoming increasingly aware of the negative impacts of spending too much time looking at a screen and are perhaps consciously unplugging our devices for an hour or so before we go to sleep,” Moody said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C., noted that nations have tried to regulate screen time.</p>\n<p>“Time-online policies are sometimes used as an attempt to lower screen times, but they are difficult for policymakers to enforce,” she told TechNewsWorld. “China, for example, instituted a three-hour-per-week limit for children playing video games. While 77% of children reduced their gaming time under this policy, 29% also reported using their parents’ accounts as a workaround to the time limit.”</p>\n<p>“Some platforms have taken voluntary steps to tackle any potential harms, with measures such as allowing users to limit their screen time and see screen-time reports, or notifying them to take a break whenever they have spent a certain amount of time on an app,” she continued.</p>\n<p>“Rather than implementing prescriptive policies that hinder user experience and leave little room for innovation, many technology companies instead adopt customizable user and parental control systems such as screen-time controls and prompts to take breaks after using the apps for extended periods of time,” she added.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple, why have you forsaken users like me? I feel like you’re beginning to take me for granted.</p>\n<p>I know that Apple is still one of the most influential tech companies on the planet, and I fully recognize that its products continue to set the bar in industrial design, brand loyalty, and ecosystem integration.</p>\n<p>But not everything is perfect in Cupertino.</p>\n<p>Despite Apple’s dominance, there are discernible cracks in the experience: frustrations that long-time users and analysts can’t ignore. Not to mention that Samsung recently <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/how-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-finally-weaned-me-off-my-iphone-addiction-179660.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extracted me</a> from the Apple ecosystem with its new Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>\n<p>While Apple continues to lead in many areas, aspects of its ecosystem have begun to show signs of wear. Here are four specific gripes that detail missed opportunities and areas for improvement for Apple in 2025.</p>\n<h3>1. The Apple Watch Feels Stagnant</h3>\n<p>When Apple Watch launched in 2015, it was a bold leap into wearables. But nearly a decade later, the product feels stuck in place.</p>\n<p>Battery life remains a glaring issue. Most baseline models still need nightly charging, which is a massive problem for a device that needs to be worn on the body and is marketed as a health monitor and sleep tracker.</p>\n<p>Even in the 2024 Series 9 and SE models, Apple hasn’t pushed the battery life boundary forward. Multi-day wear — standard in devices from competitors like Garmin or even budget Fitbit models — remains out of reach.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The design language hasn’t meaningfully evolved either. While Ultra models added bulk and utility, the mainstream Apple Watch still looks and feels like a product from five years ago.</p>\n<p>The market reflects this fatigue. According to a recent report from Counterpoint Research, global smartwatch shipments fell in 2024, with Apple losing share. The data suggests user enthusiasm is cooling — and Apple hasn’t responded with the bold rethinking it once championed.</p>\n<p>Here’s a provocative question: What if Apple treated the Watch as a health-first platform instead of just a phone accessory?</p>\n<h3>2. Apple Intelligence Isn’t Delivering a Breakthrough</h3>\n<p>There were high expectations when Apple announced its push into generative AI, dubbed Apple Intelligence. This point isn’t only my opinion, as Apple has been under fire from the media for its sluggish ability to make Apple Intelligence resonate with mainstream consumers. Not to mention that Apple changed the management leadership overseeing this capability within the company.</p>\n<p>Apple has not identified a standout usage model that resonates with a broad consumer base. There’s no “ChatGPT moment.” Instead, Apple’s AI ambitions feel vague and scattered. Features like auto-summarizing messages, writing assistance, or Siri enhancements are interesting but incremental.</p>\n<p>Saying Apple Intelligence hasn’t lit the world on fire may be an understatement.</p>\n<p>Unlike Microsoft, which integrates AI deeply into the productivity stack, or Google, which is aggressively building Gemini into its services, Apple hasn’t identified a killer use case. Nor has it clearly positioned Apple Intelligence as a system-wide differentiator.</p>\n<p>That’s problematic.</p>\n<p>Consumers are increasingly aware of AI but need to see tangible value. Apple’s AI story currently lacks urgency, clarity, and consumer pull. The company needs the proverbial “killer app” (or at least usage model) that gets mainstream consumers on board. Remember Lotus 1-2-3?</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that Apple needs to make AI feel indispensable to <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/apple-samsung-users-unimpressed-by-ai-on-their-phones-survey-179509.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">everyday users</a> — not just a list of background features.</p>\n<h3>3. The iPhone–Windows Experience Remains Painful</h3>\n<p>In 2025, cross-platform integration should be seamless.</p>\n<p>Yet, if you use an iPhone and a Windows 11 PC, it still feels like two worlds that refuse to talk. This issue is, perhaps, my biggest peeve with Apple.</p>\n<p>Basic tasks like message syncing, photo transfers, and notifications often involve clunky workarounds. There’s no true equivalent to iMessage or AirDrop on Windows — even though nearly half of U.S. users run Windows PCs.</p>\n<p>Yes, Apple and Microsoft have made minor progress. Features like iCloud integration in the Photos app or the recent Phone Link improvements are a step forward. But they’re patchwork solutions, not a cohesive strategy.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In contrast, Android users get a far smoother experience with Windows out of the box — thanks to better file sharing, notifications, and cross-app integration.</p>\n<p>Apple may want to keep its ecosystem closed. However, doing so risks alienating a massive segment of its user base that lives in both the Apple and Microsoft worlds.</p>\n<p>The question worth asking is whether the walled garden is still a strength or is becoming a liability in a multi-device/multi-brand era.</p>\n<h3>4. Apple Is Behind on Foldable Phones</h3>\n<p>Foldables are no longer a niche experiment. Samsung has iterated rapidly. Google, OnePlus, and Huawei are pushing new designs. Even midrange foldables are entering the mainstream.</p>\n<p>Yet, Apple still hasn’t entered the race.</p>\n<p>Despite years of rumors, we’ve seen no tangible movement on a foldable iPhone. There are no prototype previews, no developer hints, and no firm timeline.</p>\n<p>That’s puzzling. While Apple isn’t usually the first to enter a category, it usually sets the standard when it does. The lack of any real foldable roadmap raises questions about Apple’s willingness to take hardware risks.</p>\n<p>Some reports suggest Apple is experimenting behind the scenes. But that’s not enough. The market is maturing now, and users expect new form factors that offer flexibility, multitasking, and larger screens in compact devices.</p>\n<p>By waiting too long, Apple risks looking like a follower rather that an innovator.</p>\n<p>The hard truth is that Apple risks missing a generational hardware shift if it doesn’t show leadership here.</p>\n<h3>WWDC 2025: A Chance To Reset the Narrative</h3>\n<p>Apple still has time to correct its course, and its Worldwide Developers Conference in June is the perfect opportunity.</p>\n<p>These issues — wearable fatigue, AI uncertainty, cross-platform friction, and form factor hesitation — could be addressed through bold announcements and more precise product direction.</p>\n<p>Imagine if WWDC delivers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A redesigned Apple Watch with multi-day battery life and new health sensors</li>\n<li>A more compelling and intuitive Apple Intelligence platform that redefines mobile AI</li>\n<li>Deeper iPhone–Windows integration that finally removes the friction</li>\n<li>A foldable iPhone concept that sets a new design benchmark</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apple is unquestionably capable of all of this. The question is whether it will rethink its product roadmap and move faster.</p>\n<p>Users are no longer satisfied with just minor updates. They’re hungry for fresh ideas, more substantial experiences, and openness.</p>\n<p>WWDC could either mark a turning point or reinforce the growing perception that Apple is slowly losing its edge. So, the big question is: Will Apple rise to the occasion in June?</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>While this is about the changes in the microprocessor market and the impact of tariffs, I’ve also been extremely disappointed in Microsoft’s AI rollout.</p>\n<p>Right now, I’m working in Microsoft Word on one of HP’s latest laptops, and it asked if I wanted AI to help write this month’s column. I gave initial direction on what I wanted to cover and how I wanted to cover it.</p>\n<p>Although I’ve edited this a bit, and my editor will make more edits before publication, the result is largely what Microsoft’s AI suggested I write. I treated the AI like I would an employee, making suggestions about the content. I’m pleased with the result.</p>\n<p>So, this week, I’ll cover the microprocessor companies (at least the ones I know best) and close with my Product of the Week, Microsoft’s AI. I’m pretty pleased with this implementation, and kudos to whoever came up with this method of getting people like me to use the tool.</p>\n<p>Let’s get to it.</p>\n<h3>Microprocessor Market Update</h3>\n<p>The microprocessor market has witnessed significant transformations over the past few years, driven by technological advancements and shifts in the global economy.</p>\n<p>As the demand for high-performance computing systems continues to soar, major players like AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia have competed fiercely to capture market share and deliver innovative solutions.</p>\n<p>However, one of the pressing challenges facing this industry is the impact of tariffs on parts imported from other countries. These tariffs can lead to higher costs for PC OEMs, making the final products unaffordable for consumers.</p>\n<p>In this column, I’ll explore the current state of the microprocessor market, examine the effects of tariffs, and delve into the strategies and positions of key industry players.</p>\n<h3>AMD: Taking Names and Kicking Butt</h3>\n<p>AMD has experienced a remarkable ascent in the microprocessor market that could be attributed to its innovative architecture and competitive pricing.</p>\n<p>The introduction of the Zen microarchitecture and subsequent Ryzen processors has propelled AMD to the forefront of the industry. These processors offer exceptional performance, power efficiency, and multi-threading capabilities, making them a preferred choice for both gamers and professionals.</p>\n<p>Additionally, AMD’s strategic partnerships and acquisitions, such as the purchase of Xilinx, have further solidified its position. Let’s just say AMD’s rise has been as smooth as a jazz saxophonist on a Sunday morning.</p>\n<h3>Intel: New CEO Puts It Back on Track</h3>\n<p>Despite stiff competition from AMD, Intel has managed to hold its ground through continuous innovation and a loyal customer base. Intel’s advancements in processor technology, including the development of 10nm and 7nm nodes, have enabled the company to deliver high-performance CPUs with improved efficiency.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Intel maintains dominance in the server and enterprise markets as its Xeon processors continue to power data centers globally — although AMD is making impressive inroads. However, Intel faces challenges in the consumer market, where AMD’s Ryzen processors have gained substantial traction. Think of Intel as the tortoise in the old fable: while it has clearly had issues, it is again steady and sure, but AMD is snapping at its heels like the cheeky hare.</p>\n<p>As I was finishing this column, Intel announced it had selected a new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who had previously served as an Intel board member. I expect this was because he had backed a plan that Pat Gelsinger was against, and the board felt he was the best person to execute the plan he believed in. This move will significantly help Intel set and execute a strategy, leaving Intel in much better shape this week.</p>\n<h3>Qualcomm: Strategic Wins</h3>\n<p>Qualcomm’s presence in the microprocessor market is characterized by strategic design wins, particularly in the mobile and modem segments. While Qualcomm may have fewer design wins compared to AMD and Intel, its successes are significant due to the integration of advanced modem technologies.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors, coupled with cutting-edge modems, provide seamless connectivity and enhanced performance for mobile devices. This focus on mobile computing positions Qualcomm favorably, especially with the growing demand for 5G technology.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm may not win the popularity contest, but when it does show up, it brings the best dessert. With OEMs now taking Qualcomm 5G modems, the future of this effort appears to be getting brighter.</p>\n<h3>Nvidia: The King of AI</h3>\n<p>Nvidia continues to reign supreme in artificial intelligence (AI) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The company’s GPUs have become synonymous with AI research, development, and deployment, powering everything from autonomous vehicles to data centers.</p>\n<p>Nvidia’s CUDA platform and Tensor Cores have revolutionized AI computation, enabling faster and more efficient processing of complex algorithms. In gaming and workstation segments, especially in AI development, Nvidia is like the royalty of the tech world, with a GPU crown and an AI scepter.</p>\n<h3>Tariff Impact</h3>\n<p>One of the most significant challenges facing the microprocessor market is the imposition of tariffs on components sourced from other countries. These tariffs can lead to higher costs for PC OEMs that rely on these parts to assemble their products.</p>\n<p>The added expense of tariffs can make it difficult for OEMs to offer competitive pricing, which in turn affects consumer demand. Moreover, the tariffs on parts from the U.S. exacerbate the problem because they increase the overall cost of production. It’s like paying extra for the privilege of making your own sandwich.</p>\n<h3>The Tariff Problem</h3>\n<p>The economic implications of tariffs extend beyond the microprocessor market. Higher costs for components can lead to reduced profit margins for OEMs, forcing them to pass on the increased expenses to consumers.</p>\n<p>This situation can decrease sales and lower market penetration, especially in price-sensitive segments. Additionally, tariffs can disrupt supply chains, causing delays and inefficiencies in production.</p>\n<p>The uncertainty surrounding trade policies further complicates the planning and forecasting processes for industry players. It’s a bit like trying to knit a scarf while someone randomly hides your needles.</p>\n<h3>How OEMs Plan To Overcome Tariffs</h3>\n<p>Microprocessor companies and OEMs are exploring various strategies to address the challenges posed by tariffs. These include diversifying supply chains, seeking alternative sourcing options, and negotiating favorable trade agreements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, companies are investing in domestic manufacturing capabilities to reduce reliance on imported components. Collaboration with governments and industry associations is also crucial in advocating for policies that support fair trade and minimize tariff-related disruptions. In other words, they are juggling flaming torches while riding unicycles and still trying to look cool.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>The microprocessor market is at a pivotal juncture, with technological advancements and economic challenges shaping its trajectory. AMD’s rise to prominence, Intel’s stability, Qualcomm’s strategic design wins, and Nvidia’s dominance in AI highlight the dynamic nature of the industry.</p>\n<p>However, the impact of tariffs on components underscores the need for strategic planning and collaboration to ensure sustainable growth. By navigating these challenges effectively, industry players can continue to innovate and deliver cutting-edge solutions that drive the future of computing. Now, if only we could make tariffs as obsolete as dial-up internet.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Microsoft 365 Copilot</h3>\n<p>As I noted in the opening, I’ve been less than impressed with Microsoft’s AI rollout until now. Recall — Microsoft’s key AI feature for Copilot+ PCs — is still on hold even though Apple was able to get out more quickly with its version of this. Microsoft needs to massively up its marketing game and focus on getting people to use the product. Marketing is still largely absent, but it has improved the “use of the product” thing impressively.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Supercharge productivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMJo7BpTzmM\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Much of what was written above was written by Copilot under my direction. While I’m still a novice at finding the best way to prompt the tool, it is still impressively usable, though you do have to read through the output for accuracy. For instance, the AI wrote that Nvidia was buying Arm, a move that Nvidia had to walk away from. Thanks to my editor for also catching a couple of other errors I overlooked regarding Lip-Bu Tan and Recall.</p>\n<p>As with many writers, I often have trouble thinking through what I want to write and how I want to go about telling the story. Typically, writing this column will take me four to five hours. I got this one done in under 30 minutes, and the result, to my eye, isn’t bad.</p>\n<p>If you have an Office 365 subscription, chances are you have or can get access to this tool. If you get a chance, mess with it. It is a huge help with productivity. Even if you then decide to write from scratch, it will give you content you wouldn’t have thought of that’ll add to your story.</p>\n<p>I’m impressed, so Microsoft 365 Copilot is my Product of the Week. The dialog in Word that prompted me to try it out was also exceptionally well done — kudos to whoever created it.</p>\n",

At the forefront of this effort is Mike Fraietta, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://gargoylesystems.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gargoyle Systems</a>, who is pioneering a decentralized drone detection network to counter emerging threats and enhance public awareness of aerial activity.</p>\n<p>According to Fraietta, traditional aerial craft detection methods face challenges from dark drones — untraceable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that use channel hopping or fiber optic technology to avoid RF detection.</p>\n<p>To counteract this, Gargoyle Systems focuses on acoustic detection, particularly for fiber-optic tethered drones emitting no RF signals. These drones pose a significant challenge to authorities, as they can operate over long distances without detection.</p>\n<p>His vision for the future of drone detection and its beneficial uses is clear. A comprehensive drone detection network must protect American citizens and infrastructure while enabling the ethical use of drones for valuable applications.</p>\n<p>“The challenge isn’t just detecting drones. It’s ensuring they are used responsibly,” Fraietta told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>New Drone Detection Strategies Emerge</h3>\n<p>Fraietta launched Gargoyle Systems last year. Among its other projects, the company is developing tools to overcome limitations caused by drone intrusions. It will soon launch a product that creates a personal decentralized geo-fence or border wall that collects data on drones traversing an area.</p>\n<p>As a certified FAA drone pilot, Fraietta continually trains in drone security. He wants to monitor the changes being made to secure the southern border under new laws.</p>\n<p>“We have advisors in the FAA and Department of Defense and Homeland Security. So, we’re keeping tabs on what’s going on but are not officially involved in any way with the new folks down there or previously,” he explained.</p>\n<h3>How Drones Are Changing Border Security</h3>\n<p>While drones present security challenges, they offer groundbreaking potential for emergency services and search-and-rescue operations. Fraietta is excited about the development of “friendly drones” designed to deliver medical aid, transport essential supplies, and assist in disaster relief efforts.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179636\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179636\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Mike-Fraietta.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Fraietta\" width=\"400\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Mike-Fraietta.jpg 400w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Mike-Fraietta-297x300.jpg 297w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179636\"><span>Mike Fraietta, CEO of Gargoyle Systems</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Since January, U.S. border agents have adjusted the role that drones can play in keeping borders secure. According to Fraietta, increased collaboration now occurs between DHS, local law enforcement, and the FAA. He likens these efforts to the creation of the TSA after 9/11,</p>\n<p>“A drone czar may be needed to coordinate national drone security initiatives along with recent successes in border security,” he mused.</p>\n<p>Despite efforts to enhance drone detection, Fraietta warns that dark drones operating outside radio frequencies are the biggest concern. As a result, law enforcement agencies are increasingly turning to AI and acoustic detection to identify illicit drone activity.</p>\n<p>He explained that using acoustic detection methods relies on perfecting the ability to identify the unique sounds of the propeller pitches, among other factors.</p>\n<h3>Public Misconceptions and Drone Security Risks</h3>\n<p>The public’s perception of drone flights led to hysteria in some instances. The government’s veil of secrecy sometimes fuels fires of concern.</p>\n<p>For example, recent reports of drones flying over houses at night along the East Coast, particularly in multiple New Jersey counties and neighboring areas, stirred public concern. Some news accounts conveyed similar unexplained drone flights amid fears of surveillance or potential attacks.</p>\n<p>“Public awareness regarding drone threats is essential. We need to think about how vulnerable our power grids, water supplies, and infrastructure are to drone attacks,” Fraietta warned. “Drones’ ability to deliver dangerous payloads to critical infrastructure remains a major security concern.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Some local officials openly discussed shooting down drones. Meanwhile, some federal officials within the previous administration were emphatic that people were not seeing drones but small piloted aircraft.</p>\n<p>Amid increasing demands for transparency regarding the East Coast sightings, federal officials finally stated that the FAA authorized drone flights as part of an undisclosed test. Fraietta declined to comment, only suggesting that many of those drone sightings were unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p>“A similar situation occurred in Colorado in 2019, where mass reports of drones resulted in no government disclosure of verifiable sightings,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Cartels, Border Agents Battle for Aerial Control</h3>\n<p>Fraietta observed that AI-powered drones the cartels use are nearly as advanced as those operated by border patrol agents. Cartel drones transport narcotics, use night vision equipment, and leverage 3D printing modifications to evade detection.</p>\n<p>Cartel drone flights over the U.S. southern border could provoke an armed U.S. response. The Mexican cartels are leveraging drone technology for more than just drug smuggling, warned Fraietta without elaboration.</p>\n<p>U.S. border agents and Mexican drug cartels use them to spy on each other. One side searches for fentanyl labs, and the other tries to locate law enforcement.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“While the potential for cartel-operated drones carrying explosives exists, the risk of escalation makes it unlikely,” he cautioned. “If they start attacking border patrols, it’s a wrap. Cartels prefer to operate stealthily rather than provoke a heavy response from law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Despite efforts to enhance detection, Fraietta warns of dark drones’ persistent challenges. “Drones operating off radio frequencies are our biggest concern,” he said. Law enforcement agencies increasingly use AI and acoustic detection to identify illicit drone activity.</p>\n<h3>Ethical Debate Over Drone Technology</h3>\n<p>Drone technology raises ethical concerns, particularly around privacy and regulation. Fraietta advocates for greater investment in detection systems and a national drone security strategy.</p>\n<p>“People should know what’s flying over them, just like they know who’s on their property,” he insisted.</p>\n<p>Comparing drones to cars and firearms, he stressed the need for structured registration, licensing, and designated flight corridors to reduce noise and enhance safety. While the FAA’s Remote ID tracking is a step forward, untraceable dark drones remain a serious challenge.</p>\n<p>Fraietta believes drone security isn’t just about threat detection — it’s about ensuring responsible use. As drones continue to shape security and commerce, robust regulations and advanced detection technology will be essential. Gargoyle Systems envisions a future where decentralized networks give citizens and authorities greater visibility and control over the skies.</p>\n<p>“Law enforcement is working to counter cartel-operated drones, but the public must also stay informed about both the risks and benefits of drone use,” he concluded.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Agentic AI — getting AI to perform tasks rather than just create content from prompts — is coming to the Opera browser.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the Norwegian company announced that its agent, Browser Operator, works inside Opera and will perform tasks on the web for users.</p>\n<p>“Having an AI agent in the browser brings the advantage of letting you outsource the most monotonous tasks to the browser while you focus on the things that really matter to you,” Opera Senior Vice President Jan Standal told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>In a blog posting on its website, Opera explained that Browser Operator understands written instructions in natural language using the browser client’s local resources. Opera’s AI Composer Engine processes that information to complete tasks in the browser.</p>\n<p>Browser Operator will pause and ask a user to take action whenever it needs them to fill in a form, confirm an order, or perform some other sensitive task. In this entire process, the user is in control and can take over at any moment from Browser Operator. They can also review all the steps the agent took to perform a requested task.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Opera's Browser Operator - An AI that can do tasks for you on the web\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lLVSLAekYk\" width=\"100%\" height=\"490\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>“Many of the tasks that people perform in their internet browsers are repetitive, like scouring online retailers for the best prices or checking the same feeds for notable activity,” explained Max Vermier, senior director of AI strategy at <a href=\"https://www.abbyy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abbyy</a>, a global intelligent automation company.</p>\n<p>“Instead of spending countless minutes or even hours of your own time on these monotonous searches for information, an AI agent can autonomously gather it and present you with its findings in a fraction of the time,” he told TechNewsWorld. “AI agents can be your personal productivity assistant, taking on your busy work and allowing you to make consequential decisions.”</p>\n<p>“It’s like having a personal assistant who automatically helps with all tasks online — from planning and booking a vacation to keeping track of property tax deadlines,” added Ambuj Kumar, founder of <a href=\"https://simbian.ai \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simbian</a>, a provider of autonomous AI agents for cybersecurity in Mountain View, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Not only is the idea very powerful and completely feasible today,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but this could be one of those technologies that helps everyone.”</p>\n<h3>First Native AI Agent</h3>\n<p>Although other browsers have incorporated AI features, Opera is the first to make an AI agent native to a browser.</p>\n<p>“The concept is not new, but the way that Opera is implementing it is new,” said Sandi Besen, an applied AI researcher at IBM and <a href=\"https://www.neudesic.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neudesic</a>, a global professional services company.</p>\n<p>Other companies capture screenshots and screen videos and send them to their AI models in the cloud to follow through on actions. Browser Operator interacts with the elements on a web page through Document Object Model technology.</p>\n<p>“Basically, the DOM is automatically created by the browser,” Besen told TechNewsWorld. “It’s essentially an in-memory representation of the web page’s structure.”</p>\n<p>One advantage of using DOM, she noted, is it creates a more seamless user experience because it’s more native to the browser environment.</p>\n<p>It improves the agent’s performance, too. “It doesn’t need to take a screenshot, send that to the model, wait for what the model wants to do next, and then execute a tool to make something happen in the browser,” she explained. “Instead, it can just access the web page data.”</p>\n<p>“It also enhances privacy because everything is done locally on the device,” she continued. “It’s not being run or sent to a server or a cloud-based hosted model somewhere. So the information’s being kept locally, which is better for privacy concerns, especially if you’re navigating things like login information or passwords.”</p>\n<p>Komninos Chatzipapas, founder of <a href=\"https://herahaven.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HeraHaven AI</a>, developer of an AI-based virtual companion app, in St. Petersburg, Fla. added that a significant advantage of doing agentic AI natively and locally on the browser is, unlike the cloud approach of OpenAI’s Operator, users will already be logged into all their accounts. “You will be using your local IP, so you won’t need to solve captchas every other minute like on Operator,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Can Opera’s AI Shift Market Share?</h3>\n<p>Opera’s innovative approach could give it some leverage in a market where it has been only a niche player. “This is one potential advantage for Opera,” said Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“Others treat browsers as cost centers and thus don’t put much development emphasis on them,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Opera, by focusing advancement on their browser, could move around the more established players if users find this feature compelling, and they may.”</p>\n<p>He argued that Browser Operator could have an impact on Opera’s market share. “It depends on how well Opera can get the word out, get influencers to use the feature, and then get to a critical mass of regular users to drive an adoption wave,” he said.</p>\n<p>In theory, Opera’s Browser Operator AI could enhance its market position by differentiating it from competitors, noted Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“By integrating agentic AI for automation, search efficiency, and task execution, Opera may attract tech-savvy users,” he told TechNewsWorld. “However, market impact depends on execution, adoption rates, and competition from big-hitter AI-enhanced browsers like Edge, Copilot, and Chrome, with Gemini.”</p>\n<p>Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out that AI innovation hasn’t been successful in the past in disgorging market share from entrenched players.</p>\n<p>“Microsoft’s launching of an AI-infused Bing brought more attention to that search engine than we had seen in a long time, but it hasn’t meaningfully moved the needle for Bing in terms of search engine share,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“And there’s less of a barrier going to Bing instead of Google, as opposed to downloading a whole new browser,” he said. “So, Browser Operator is probably not going to do much in terms of Opera’s relative standing.”</p>\n<h3>AI Agents Everywhere</h3>\n<p>Browser Operator is just the first of what will be a proliferation of AI agents, predicted David Johnston, a contributor to <a href=\"https://djohnstonec.medium.com/morpheus-658bfd4a0617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morpheus</a>, an open-source platform for launching smart agents. “All browsers will include them, as the productivity increases are amazing,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“AI is in discovery mode, and people are experimenting with where to best access its powers,” he said. “From websites to dedicated apps, smart agents will be everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“Web browsers are there to make you more powerful while you’re online, browsing the web and to give you the tools to use your time more effectively,” Opera’s Standal added. “Browser Operator showcases that we have the capability of making a useful and smart tool within the browser — which aligns with the overall objective of a web browser of being useful.”</p>\n<p>“With this feature preview we’re showing a proof of concept of where AI could take us when we use AI to leverage our work building a web browser — and this applies to every industry,” he said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Western automotive giants face an existential challenge as China’s carmakers surge ahead. Much of China’s edge comes from how its automotive sector is structured: streamlined, fast, and incredibly tech-forward.</p>\n<p>R&amp;D cycles for Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) typically span just nine to 18 months. In contrast, many Western automakers require five to seven years to bring a new vehicle from concept to production. If this gap isn’t closed — and fast — the Western auto industry could become irrelevant by 2030.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about how Intel and others could save the auto industry. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week: the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i 14-inch AI PC.</p>\n<h3>China’s Fast-Moving Auto Sector</h3>\n<p>One critical reason for China’s lead is its organizational agility. Chinese car companies operate under more linear leadership models, where decision-making is centralized and fast. There’s minimal bureaucracy, and product development teams are tightly aligned with executive leadership.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Western companies often operate under legacy structures built over decades, with siloed departments and multilayered chains of approval. These structures kill speed. In today’s hypercompetitive environment, time is everything.</p>\n<h3>Why Chinese Carmakers Delay Hardware Decisions</h3>\n<p>Another strategic advantage Chinese carmakers have embraced is choosing hardware last. Instead of locking in chipsets, cameras, and sensors early in development, they build vehicles on flexible, software-defined architectures. This approach allows them to integrate the most advanced technologies available at the time of launch, ensuring they’re not stuck with obsolete systems by the time the car hits the road.</p>\n<p>Western automakers still operate in reverse: they make hardware decisions early, which locks the vehicle into slower and less capable tech. That’s why you can buy a brand-new car and still be disappointed to find that the infotainment system and other tech features haven’t advanced much from what was available a decade ago.</p>\n<h3>Enter Intel and the Tech Sector</h3>\n<p>At this point, Intel and other tech giants could dramatically alter the trajectory of Western automotive companies. Intel has deep roots in high-speed innovation and leading technology transitions. It could provide crucial expertise in agile development practices, hardware/software integration, and modular platform design.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>One key area is photonics, a revolutionary technology that enables data to travel as light rather than electrical signals. Intel is among the world leaders in silicon photonics and could guide carmakers in replacing expensive, heavy, and increasingly bandwidth-constrained copper wiring with fiber-optic solutions.</p>\n<p>Photonics doesn’t only reduce weight — it drastically improves data transmission speeds, making it ideal for next-generation vehicles loaded with sensors and AI modules.</p>\n<h3>Intel, AMD Partnership Could Save Western Carmakers</h3>\n<p>In the early days of the PC revolution, Intel and AMD drove massive innovation by functioning as second-source partners, providing interchangeable processors that helped standardize the personal computing landscape.</p>\n<p>This model could be revived for automotive computing. Currently, Qualcomm and Nvidia dominate the automotive AI chipset space, but a renewed Intel-AMD alliance could give automakers a flexible, competitive alternative.</p>\n<p>To unlock this potential, the two firms should consider standardizing common sockets or board layouts, much like they did in the x86 era. Standardization would allow automakers to adopt a single-vehicle compute architecture and choose between Intel and AMD for different trim levels to overcome product shortages or regional variants, dramatically reducing development costs and improving sourcing resilience.</p>\n<p>In addition, both AMD and Intel are highly scalable at the socket level, allowing better upgrade paths and enabling last-minute or post-sales enhancements that could generate new revenue for dealers.</p>\n<h3>AI Will Reshape the Future of the Auto Industry</h3>\n<p>AI is poised to radically reshape the automotive landscape. The rise of Cars-as-a-Service (CaaS) models, autonomous vehicle fleets, and real-time predictive maintenance will fundamentally change the economics of mobility.</p>\n<p>In the future, owning a car may be less attractive, especially in urban environments. Consumers will demand smarter, more connected, and constantly improving vehicles. Automakers will need to shift from building static machines to offering dynamic, software-defined platforms.</p>\n<p>Tech companies understand this realm deeply. Firms like Intel, Google, and Amazon are already experts in cloud integration, edge processing, real-time analytics, and software monetization. By partnering with these firms, car companies can accelerate their transition to the automotive-as-a-platform model.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Clock Is Ticking for Western Carmakers</h3>\n<p>China isn’t just ahead in the EV race — it’s accelerating. Brands like BYD, Nio, and XPeng already deliver world-class electric vehicles at unbeatable prices. They’re expanding globally and investing heavily in autonomy and AI.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Western carmakers remain hamstrung by legacy supply chains, outdated software stacks, and glacial product cycles. Without bold, immediate action, many could face extinction by 2030.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This is where Intel and its peers offer more than chips — they offer a lifeline. By helping legacy manufacturers reimagine their cultures, processes, and architectures, tech companies can serve as strategic partners in a much-needed reinvention.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>The opportunity is immense, but so is the risk. Carmakers that don’t rapidly adopt fast-cycle development, modular compute architectures, photonics, and AI-driven service models will not only lose market share — they’ll become irrelevant.</p>\n<p>If Intel, AMD, and their ecosystem allies work hand-in-hand with automakers to build next-generation vehicles, they won’t just help an industry survive — they’ll help it thrive in a world where speed, intelligence, and adaptability decide who leads and who’s left behind.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\"></p>\n<h3>HP EliteBook Ultra G1i 14-inch AI PC</h3>\n<p>HP’s new <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-ultra-g1i-14-inch-notebook-next-gen-ai-pc-wolf-pro-security-edition-p-b69ytua-aba-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EliteBook Ultra G1i 14-inch</a> is one of the first next-generation AI PCs to hit the market.

      "content": "<p>NTT is one of the most powerful technology conglomerates in the world. As a telecommunications giant, the company operates a global network infrastructure, ranks among the top three data center providers worldwide, and employs more than 330,000 people.</p>\n<p>Through its NTT Data subsidiary, it boasts deep expertise in cybersecurity, next-gen networking, quantum research, and enterprise IT services. With these assets, NTT should be positioned as an industry-defining force in the AI-powered future.</p>\n<p>However, at its recent NTT Research Upgrade 2025 event, it chose not to lead.</p>\n<p>Instead, a bold, clear articulation of vision and ambition became a disjointed series of ideas, framed more as academic explorations than strategic imperatives.</p>\n<p>Lofty language, vague metaphors, and philosophical asides dominated the company’s core messaging. While the technology showcased was real and impressive, the leadership tone was tentative — more deferential to partners than a directive to the market.</p>\n<p>In short, NTT missed the moment, which is a strategic misstep for a company with its capabilities.</p>\n<h3>Ambitious Language, Unclear Strategy</h3>\n<p>NTT Executive Chairman Jun Sawada opened the keynote with expansive, almost poetic language. He spoke about “upgrading reality,” building a “network of AIs,” and promoting a “pluralistic value society.”</p>\n<p>He referenced philosophical inquiries and the creation of the Kyoto Institute of Philosophy, aiming to bring together Eastern and Western thought in shaping the future of human-AI coexistence.</p>\n<p>These are intriguing themes. However, they lacked anchoring in a keynote intended to showcase technology leadership — which turned into a couple of fireside-style chats.</p>\n<p>There was little connection to product roadmaps, customer impact, or near-term business outcomes. Sawada spoke of IOWN — the company’s ambitious, Innovative Optical and Wireless Network — but left unexplained how this infrastructure uniquely enables or differentiates NTT in the AI race.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Sawada mentioned the importance of connecting AIs to build a “heterogeneous world” but stopped short of detailing what NTT is building to realize that goal.</p>\n<p>The result? The keynote felt more like a symposium on the philosophy of technology than a declaration of leadership.</p>\n<p>For NTT, whose customer base includes some of the world’s most demanding enterprise and government clients, that was a missed opportunity to inspire confidence.</p>\n<h3>Research Focus Felt Like Strategic Retreat</h3>\n<p>Kazu Gomi, CEO of NTT Research, doubled down on the company’s commitment to basic research. He described NTT’s Silicon Valley-based research labs and their work in applied physics, cryptography, and cardiovascular bio digital twins. To his credit, he was refreshingly candid in admitting that much of this research may not become a commercial product in the near term.</p>\n<p>Again, this level of scientific humility is understandable from a university lab. However, from a Fortune Global 100 enterprise, it comes across as strategic deferral.</p>\n<p>Gomi introduced a new concept called “Physics of AI,” which is meant to demystify how AI systems work and increase their trustworthiness. However, his description leaned heavily on metaphors, such as apples falling from trees and Newtonian physics, and lacked tangible proof points or technical framing.</p>\n<p>Yet, there was no discussion of frameworks, metrics, or deliverables. There is no sense of how this new initiative would generate a competitive advantage for NTT or its customers. There was no call to action for industry partners; it was just an abstract pitch.</p>\n<p>In a world where competitors like Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Google are integrating AI into everything from data centers to developer tools, NTT’s insistence on staying in the research phase feels like a reluctance to lead.</p>\n<h3>Snowflake and NTT Data Filled the Vacuum</h3>\n<p>Ironically, the most substantive content of the event came from outside NTT’s core corporate leadership.</p>\n<p>Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy delivered a practical, compelling roadmap for enterprise AI adoption. He described how Snowflake helps clients extract value from their internal data, build AI copilots, and deploy production-grade chatbots. He emphasized trust, efficiency, and ease of deployment—core values that enterprise buyers care deeply about.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>NTT Data CEO Abhijit Dubey provided a similarly focused perspective. He highlighted four innovation areas: quantum computing, voice mining, attribute-based encryption, and trusted data spaces. Each was tied to real-world customer stories: BMW, Japan Post Bank, and smart city pilots. These were clear, testable use cases tied to value delivery.</p>\n<p>But therein lies the disconnect. These leaders made the case for innovation. NTT itself did not.</p>\n<p>While Snowflake and NTT Data sounded like organizations building and delivering the future, NTT Corporation remained in the background — host to a conversation it should have been driving.</p>\n<h3>Failure To Connect the Dots</h3>\n<p>NTT has everything it needs to be a global technology leader in the AI era:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A top-tier worldwide fiber and wireless network</li>\n<li>Massive data center presence, especially in high-growth markets like India</li>\n<li>Deep talent in quantum science, cybersecurity, and encryption</li>\n<li>An enterprise customer base that spans industries and continents</li>\n<li>An IT services division (NTT Data) that is among the largest in the world</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But Upgrade 2025 failed to tie these assets into a coherent strategic narrative.</p>\n<p>There was no aggressive positioning of IOWN as the backbone for AI-native networking. There was no clear articulation of how NTT’s data center footprint enables sovereign AI or edge intelligence. No insight was provided into how NTT’s research labs fuel product innovation pipelines, and perhaps most surprisingly, there was no bold statement about how NTT intends to compete in an industry that is moving at unprecedented speed.</p>\n<p>NTT didn’t use its stage to declare leadership. It used it to float ideas and host guests. For a company of its size, that’s a passive stance and a missed opportunity to drive the conversation forward.</p>\n<h3>The Stakes Are Higher Than Ever</h3>\n<p>Enterprise buyers are not looking for abstract promises. They want trusted partners who can deliver secure, scalable AI infrastructure, integrate with their systems, and help them navigate complexity.</p>\n<p>Government clients want solutions they can control and deploy locally. Telecom and cloud operators are battling to redefine the role of connectivity in an AI-native world.</p>\n<p>NTT could lead all of these markets. It has the assets. It has the talent, and, most crucially, it has the credibility. But to compete, it must first lead with confidence and clarity.</p>\n<p>Upgrade 2025 was a chance to assert its leadership and showcase NTT’s technology, purpose, business model, and vision for where the AI-powered enterprise is going. Instead, it chose the safety of abstraction.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts: A Stage Missed</h3>\n<p>NTT doesn’t need consumer recognition. It doesn’t sell smartphones or search engines. Its impact is felt behind the scenes — where networks are built, data is stored, and enterprise systems are connected. That makes forums like Upgrade 2025 especially important. They are the rare public moments where NTT can show the market what it stands for.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the company didn’t do itself any favors at this year’s event. It did not strengthen its position as an unabashed thought leader. It did not clarify how its formidable portfolio of technologies, across infrastructure, research, and services, comes together to solve enterprise and societal challenges — and it certainly did not project urgency.</p>\n<p>In a market where AI adoption is now a race — not a roadmap — NTT’s hesitance to lead was palpable. The company may have world-class technology and ideas, but at Upgrade 2025, it left leadership on the table.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>While components in most desktop computers can be easily — well, relatively easily — replaced, laptops tend to be far more difficult to upgrade or replace. Intel is pushing a modular concept that could make upgrading your laptop less expensive than buying a new one and substantially reduce e-waste.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Dell introduced Concept Luna, a laptop design featuring modular components that could be upgraded through a robotic upgrade station at a retailer. Similar to a vending machine, the system allowed a robot to handle the upgrade process.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about modular computers that started with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IBM PCjr</a>, moved to an IBM modular computer concept (I was approached to be CEO for one of the potential spin-off companies), the Dell effort, and finally, the Intel concept this week.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a brand-new laptop that could be ideal for an executive or someone interested in a lot of performance in a small, quiet form factor.</p>\n<h3>A Brief History of Modular PCs</h3>\n<p>The IBM PCjr was a revolutionary desktop design based on the ability to update the product easily. Updated components were packaged kind of like game cartridges in that you buy the basic system and then upgrade it by purchasing and adding components that were covered in plastic and could be plugged into the base unit.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing design until the folks doing the more expensive IBM PC figured out it was so much better and cheaper that folks would likely prefer it over IBM’s more expensive, non-modular products. So, they crippled the PCjr by removing a lot of what would have made it attractive for business (the PCjr was positioned as a consumer PC). While making it unattractive for business, they also made it unappealing for the rest of us, so the product failed.</p>\n<p>Now, compare that approach to what Steve Jobs did with the iPod. He realized customers would likely prefer a phone with the iPod’s functionality. Instead of crippling the iPhone to protect the iPod, he leaned into the trend and ended up nearly owning the entire smartphone segment. That strategic move is largely why Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world.</p>\n<p>If IBM had done the same with the PCjr, it would have protected its leadership position in PCs and might have been in that business today.</p>\n<p>The next modular effort was the <a href=\"https://www.halfhill.com/byte/1995-10_cover-archistrat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Archistrat 4s</a> server from a company staffed with ex-IBM people called the Panda Project. It used a passive backplane, allowing components to be easily plugged in or removed to add accessories. The entire system was housed in a vault-like case — made of heavy metal, lockable for security, and designed to be bolted to the floor — so offices without server rooms could keep it in open areas without worrying about theft.</p>\n<p>That company failed because the executives had inferior financial skills and wasted a lot of money on parties, jets, and other things not related to the business.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The next attempt was the IBM MetaPad, a modular computer with a core computing unit about the size of a cigarette pack, containing everything except a battery, keyboard, or display. It could be placed in a laptop case or docked on a desktop.</p>\n<p>A company called Antelope Technologies pursued a similar concept, aiming to create a market for it. However, due to its unique design and low initial production volume, it was relatively expensive, as were the docks that could have been integrated into cars, hospitals, hotel rooms, or even airplane seats, providing full PC functionality and an easy upgrade path for the core technology.</p>\n<p>The problem was that the core module wasn’t very powerful due to thermal and cost constraints, and docks for it never became widely available in the places they were envisioned. As a result, it never reached the necessary volume to drive down costs. Performance was also an issue — mobile PC technology at the time wasn’t efficient enough to make the concept viable in a laptop form. By then, IBM had begun shifting away from the PC market and was unwilling to throw money at a project like this. So, it died.</p>\n<p>More recently, Dell developed a green project, <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-look-dells-concept-luna-modular-laptop-is-back-and-more-refined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Concept Luna</a>, that used a robotic upgrade machine that could be placed at locations like Best Buy so users could quickly and cheaply upgrade, modify, or personalize their laptop. This was one of the most well-thought-out concepts I’ve ever seen. The benefits started with a massive potential for reduced e-waste, lower lifetime PC ownership costs, and potentially more loyal customers. Sadly, Dell decided not to bring it to market.</p>\n<p>And that brings us to …</p>\n<h3>Intel’s New Modular Laptop and Desktop Vision</h3>\n<p>Like Dell’s Concept Luna, <a href=\"https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Modular-PC-Design-A-Sustainable-Approach-for-Enhanced/post/1657681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intel’s modular effort</a> appears primarily focused on reducing e-waste. It would have similar advantages to other earlier modular concepts by reducing life cycle costs, increasing design innovation by making it far less expensive to develop new design concepts, allowing the parts of a laptop that don’t wear out to remain in service, and enabling greater customization in the market.</p>\n<p>This approach could lower upgrade costs for Intel and other component manufacturers while driving post-sale demand for CPUs and GPUs. It would also make it far easier for users to repair their laptops and provide relatively low-cost upgrades for almost every internal component.</p>\n<p>On the desktop side, Intel appears to be revisiting the Panda Project concept of a passive backplane, making it easier to upgrade motherboard components. Even though desktop PCs are more straightforward to upgrade, swapping out the motherboard is a PITA, and I often just donate my old desktop and start with a new case when I get a new motherboard.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>With Intel’s design, instead of unscrewing the motherboard and hoping the new one fits, users could simply replace one or more plug-in cards, similar to the PCjr concept decades ago. Water-cooled implementations might still be tricky, but you could get around that by using quick disconnects and CPU modules that would hook up to the case’s water-cooling solution.</p>\n<p>This approach could enable users to swap out a PC’s CPU as easily as a GPU, enhancing chip-level competition and expanding the total addressable market (TAM) for modular components like CPUs, chipsets, and modems.</p>\n<p>In short, it would increase revenue in the market, allow for creativity in desktop and laptop PC design, and significantly reduce e-waste.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> Intel has had a tough year so far after losing its iconic CEO Pat Gelsinger and being pushed into breaking up, getting acquired, or merging — but it’s still kicking, and this modular computing effort could help it pull out of its spiral.</p>\n<p>What’s kind of ironic is that back in Andy Grove’s day, Pat Gelsinger led an effort to increase PC innovation, making me think this effort might have been connected to him somehow. In any case, it showcases that Intel isn’t done innovating and is still working hard to change the future of the PC. I genuinely hope it can bring this concept to market.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>HP EliteBook G1a 14-inch Notebook</h3>\n<p>Last week, I got a new laptop to play with, the <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-x-g1a-14-inch-notebook-next-gen-ai-pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP EliteBook X G1a 14-inch</a>. The one they sent me didn’t have the OLED display that I would have favored, but the standard display isn’t bad, and it’s a lot easier on the battery since the OLED screen reduces battery life by around two hours.</p>\n<p>This laptop is one of the first to use HP’s Poly Camera Pro software, which significantly improves the video conferencing experience with more natural backgrounds and a host of features that can make you look better in remote meetings.</p>\n<p>It is a full Copilot+ machine based on AMD’s latest processor and graphics technology, and it performs like a champ. AMD has really stepped it up with mobile computers this year, and unlike older AMD designs which tended to lag Intel, this effort is very competitive.</p>\n<p>The EliteBook X G1a starts at just under $2,200 and can go up to nearly $2,800 if you want a touch OLED display, more storage, and more memory. All of the display options are 400 nits, which is fine, but they will likely wash out in direct sunlight — although HP does a nice job with antiglare technology, so it should work well enough outside in a pinch.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HP-EliteBook-G1a-14-inch-notebook.jpg\" alt=\"HP EliteBook X G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HP-EliteBook-G1a-14-inch-notebook.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HP-EliteBook-G1a-14-inch-notebook-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HP-EliteBook-G1a-14-inch-notebook-768x430.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The HP EliteBook X G1a 14-inch Notebook (Image Credit: HP)</p>\n<p>Without the OLED screen, it will get up to 17 hours of battery life watching movies, but less if you do something CPU- or GPU-intensive. With an NPU and 55 TOPS, this is one of the better AI PC configurations, and HP has gone to a lot of trouble to make it really quiet.</p>\n<p>The laptop uses an impressive amount of recycled material, though you’d never know it from its premium design. While not a hardened PC, it has passed some military-specified tests, suggesting it is more robust than most in its class. As with most HP PCs, it includes strong security features, such as blurting the screen if it detects someone looking over your shoulder.</p>\n<p>Beyond its durability and security features, this is also one of the first AI PCs to fully embrace AI capabilities, including an AI companion for workflow assistance, an AI-enhanced webcam, rapid document and chart analysis, and an AI-powered service and support experience—something likely to become more common.</p>\n<p>Designed for tech experts like software developers and IT executives, the laptop delivers strong performance that both groups will appreciate. While not built for gaming or workstation-level tasks, it remains a high-performing PC that competes well in its category.</p>\n<p>Overall, the HP EliteBook G1a 14-inch is a pretty awesome laptop and my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Although many women take the traditional IT route into cybersecurity, a large portion (37%) have entered cyber from non-IT or military positions, according to a survey released Friday by <a href=\"https://www.isc2.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ISC2</a>, the organization that maintains and administers the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification exam.</p>\n<p>The organization reported that a significantly higher percentage of women than men who participated in the same study have leveraged education, professional development, self-initiated experience opportunities, and apprenticeships to pursue their careers.</p>\n<p>The report also noted that 56% of women respondents said their organizations are already changing their hiring requirements to bring in more people from non-cybersecurity backgrounds. “This is illustrative of employer efforts globally to widen the potential cybersecurity talent pool without compromising standards,” the report maintained.</p>\n<p>“This is something that we currently observe not only in cybersecurity but in tech roles in general,” said Žydrūnė Vitaitė, business unit manager for Monitum, a software-as-a-service company specializing in smart security solutions with offices in Sweden and Lithuania, and a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.womengotech.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women Go Tech</a>, an NGO that focuses on empowering women in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>“First of all, women who had previously built careers in different sectors have more diverse backgrounds, stronger problem-solving skills, and advanced pattern recognition skills,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Another key advantage here is transferable skills,” she continued. “Such women can work in dynamic environments, where not only knowledge but traits such as curiosity, problem-solving, creativity, and other aspects matter.”</p>\n<p>“From our experience in re- and up-skilling programs, we have seen adult women in their thirties to forties deciding to shift from non-tech to tech, and they do it exceptionally successfully,” she added.</p>\n<h3>Non-IT Backgrounds Open Cybersecurity Doors</h3>\n<p>Thomas Vick, a technology hiring and consulting expert at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/\">Robert Half</a>, a global staffing and recruiting firm, explained that hiring individuals with non-IT backgrounds can often bring diverse perspectives and problem-solving approaches shaped by their unique experiences.</p>\n<p>“For example, there is a growing demand for interpersonal and management skills in IT roles, underscoring the importance of understanding and integrating business methodologies into technological development,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Professionals with strong communication, critical thinking, and project management experience can often enhance an IT team’s effectiveness,” he added. “Their varied experiences often lead to creative solutions and a more holistic understanding of the work being done.”</p>\n<p>Alyson Laderman, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.akylade.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akylade</a>, a provider of cybersecurity certifications with offices in Florida, pointed out that it can be difficult for women to gain IT experience because it, too, is a male-dominated field.</p>\n<p>The problem is worse now because of shrinking opportunities, she added. “There’s not as many of those entry-level-type IT positions to get into — to be able to start there and then move up to cyber,” she told TechNewsWorld. “So I think what you’re seeing is a shift in the workforce in general, both in terms of gender, but also in terms of opportunity as to IT being a feeder into cybersecurity.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Teresa Rothaar, a governance, risk, and compliance analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company in Chicago, noted that the climate for women in cybersecurity has been showing signs of improvement over the past few years. “However, it still faces substantial challenges,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Significant work still needs to be done to ensure equal opportunities and a supportive environment for women in this industry.”</p>\n<p>“Ongoing challenges to women’s advancement in cybersecurity include significant underrepresentation, as women remain notably outnumbered in cybersecurity roles despite efforts to close the gap, and men continue to dominate the field, particularly in leadership and technical positions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“The workplace culture in many cybersecurity environments can be unwelcoming to women, with issues such as gender bias, lack of recognition, and sometimes a hostile work environment hindering their progress and retention in the field,” she continued.</p>\n<p>“Gender pay gaps persist in cybersecurity, with women often earning less than their male counterparts for similar roles, a disparity that is particularly pronounced in tech fields,” she added. “Women in cybersecurity also face barriers to career advancement, including fewer opportunities for promotions and leadership roles, as well as a lack of support for continuing education and professional development.”</p>\n<h3>Education as Pathway Into Cyber</h3>\n<p>The ISC2 report also noted that alongside the strong percentage of candidates leveraging IT experience to get into cybersecurity, advanced education was a significant pathway into these roles, although more so for women than men.</p>\n<p>Nearly a quarter (24%) of women respondents said they came in with a cybersecurity-related undergraduate degree (compared to 18% of men), and 23% of women (18% of men) entered a cybersecurity role with an undergraduate degree in a field not directly linked to cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>In addition, 18% of women respondents (12% of men) noted that they held an advanced degree — a postgraduate qualification such as a master’s or a doctorate — in a cybersecurity-related subject before taking up a cybersecurity role. For non-cybersecurity advanced degrees, 16% of women respondents (11% of men) held these qualifications before entering the cybersecurity workforce.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Men get hired on potential. Women get hired on proven ability,” Laderman argued. “Women are almost required to get that higher education, get more experience, to be able to show that they are of the same value of what typically men would be potentially capable of doing.”</p>\n<p>“It’s clearly not a fair standard, but it’s something I myself have been through,” she added.</p>\n<p>Vitaitė noted that women in her organization’s programs also tend to have higher education levels — and many certificates — in various subjects. “Unfortunately, this is a consequence of lower self-esteem and willingness to boost confidence and employability with hard knowledge,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Women also tend to apply later in the process of a career shift,” she continued. “They want to build a knowledge base and prove it via formal and informal education. Only later do they apply for the roles — usually when they meet 80% to 90% of the requirements. Men tend to apply to the roles much earlier and learn on the go.”</p>\n<h3>Value of Cybersecurity Certifications</h3>\n<p>Another finding by the ISC2 report was that beyond career and formal education, women place a significant emphasis on certifications and professional development to support their efforts when securing and furthering a cybersecurity career path. Holding a cybersecurity certification before entering their first job in cybersecurity was cited by 18% of women respondents and 16% of men.</p>\n<p>“Because cybersecurity is a relatively new field, certifications are a great way for professionals to transition into it from another field,” said Julia Toothacre, chief career strategist at <a href=\"https://www.resumetemplates.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Resume Templates</a>.</p>\n<p>“Mid-career professionals who have experience in another area might benefit from various certifications to increase their chances of getting hired,” she told TechNewsWorld. “I don’t think there is a gendered perspective when it comes to certifications. It’s really based on a combination of experience and education, which will vary between everyone — male or female.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Rob Rashotte, vice president of global training and technical field enablement at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fortinet.com\">Fortinet</a>, a provider of firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, endpoint security, and antivirus programs in Sunnyvale, Calif., added that reexamining and revising education and training requirements for cybersecurity roles is a great place to start to address the existing workforce shortage in the domain.</p>\n<p>“Many organizations are still likely overlooking solid candidates,” he told TechNewsWorld. “While many companies have diversity hiring goals, we aren’t seeing hiring numbers increase significantly among women, minorities, and veterans.”</p>\n<p>According to Fortinet’s 2024 Global Cybersecurity Skills Gap Report, despite 91% of respondents saying they prefer to hire candidates with technical certifications, 71% of organizations require potential new hires to hold a four-year degree. “Organizations should be identifying candidates who possess the right soft skills and then using certifications to help them gain cybersecurity-specific knowledge,” Rashotte maintained.</p>\n<p>He added, “According to the report, most leaders are open to this approach, with 89% of respondents saying they would pay for an employee to obtain a certification.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>One knock against smartphones with built-in parental controls is that while they may give mom and dad a measure of comfort, they’re just too uncool for kids. Human Mobile Devices (<a href=\"https://www.hmd.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HMD</a>), a Finland-based phone maker, believes it can address that problem with its new HMD X1 phone announced on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“At HMD, we believe kids shouldn’t have to choose between safety and having a smartphone they love,” Global Chief Marketing Officer Lars Silberbauer said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Parents have been asking for a solution that balances protection with freedom, and the HMD X1 delivers just that,” he continued. “We’ve worked closely with families on our Better Phone Project to gain insight into how we can create a device that looks and feels like a premium smartphone while offering the safety guardrails parents need.”</p>\n<p>“This is a big step in redefining what a first phone should be — one that gives kids a safe start in the digital world without feeling left out,” he added.</p>\n<p>HMD launched The Better Phone Project in July 2024 to tackle the impact of smartphone use on the well-being of children and young people worldwide.</p>\n<p>In its first global survey of 10,000 parents, HMD found that 75% fear smartphones expose their children to internet dangers, while 65% worry about the impact of phone use on their child’s mental health. In addition, more than half of parents surveyed regret giving their child a smartphone too soon.</p>\n<h3>Parental Controls in a Phone That Slays</h3>\n<p>The new HMD X1 gives parents complete control over their child’s smartphone experience. It features a customizable app and internet access, allowing parents to limit social media, browsing, and screen time. It also includes location tracking with safe zones, emergency SOS calling, low battery alerts, and remote device access for parents.</p>\n<p>What’s more, there’s a School Mode function that locks specific apps and features to minimize distractions during school hours. All settings can be managed remotely through an app by Xplora Technologies on a parent’s device, enabling them to adjust controls in real time based on their child’s needs and environment. Oslo, Norway-based Xplora specializes in smartwatches and wearable devices for children.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Xplora-parental-control-app.jpg\" alt=\"Xplora parental control app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Xplora-parental-control-app.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Xplora-parental-control-app-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Xplora-parental-control-app-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Xplora’s parental control app allows parents to manage the HMD X1 remotely, including location tracking, messaging, and device settings.</p>\n<p>As for the hardware, the X1 has a 108MP AI-powered camera, a 5000mAh battery, facial and fingerprint recognition unlock technology, and IP54-rated splash resistance. It also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, which seems to be making a comeback with the younger set.</p>\n<p>The phone has a modular design, which can be customized with add-on “Outfits.” For example, the Gaming Outfit turns the X1 into a gaming console, the Flashy Outfit adds a built-in ring light for selfies, and the Power Outfit provides extra battery life for extended use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HMD-X1-Outfits.jpg\" alt=\"HMD X1 Outfits\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HMD-X1-Outfits.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HMD-X1-Outfits-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/HMD-X1-Outfits-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>HMD X1’s modular design allows users to customize their phone with interchangeable “Outfits,” including a gaming controller and a back-facing ring light for enhanced photography and video recording.</p>\n<p>“It’s a solution that checks all the boxes, but in real life, you have to look at what kids want to have,” observed John Strand of Strand Consulting, a consulting firm with a focus on telecom, in Denmark. “They don’t want to go around with a phone that’s not cool. They want an iPhone or an Android phone.”</p>\n<p>“It’s like when I say I want to go to a nice burger bar and get a really good burger, but my kids say they want to go to McDonald’s,” he told TechNewsWorld. “I think the day you can convince your kids to use a phone like this is probably the day you can convince them not to go to McDonald’s.”</p>\n<h3>Content Monitoring Matters in Kids’ Phones</h3>\n<p>“Kids aren’t just little adults, and their brains don’t work the same way,” explained Titania Jordan, chief parent officer at <a href=\"https://www.bark.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bark Technologies</a>, a parental control and monitoring solutions company in Atlanta, and author of “Parental Control: A Guide to Raising Balanced Kids in the Digital Era.”</p>\n<p>“Exposure to social media, violent content, bullying, online predators, and other serious things can drastically affect a child’s well-being,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Because of this, parents need to be super involved in their child’s digital world. Unfortunately, phones built for adults –your regular iPhones and Androids — don’t have robust parental controls that actually work.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Phones built for kids, on the other hand, should have specific tools to help protect children and put parents in the driver’s seat — from approving every new contact to managing screen time and blocking inappropriate websites to content analysis,” she said.</p>\n<p>While the HMD X1 is better for a child than an iPhone, it doesn’t contain content monitoring to alert parents to the very real dangers that children encounter online, Jordan noted. “Unless a parent is going through every text, DM, comment, Google search, and countless other digital activities — and that’s highly unlikely — they are going to miss potential issues and dangers their child encounters,” she maintained.</p>\n<p>“Many parents also don’t know how to decipher teen slang terms or truly understand the different types of apps they may be allowing for their kids,” she continued. “One of the largest dangers facing children is the predatory and manipulative nature of chats in games, and content monitoring alerts parents to inappropriate conversations that could lead to grooming.”</p>\n<p>“Content monitoring is the defining feature of a thoughtful and safer kid’s phone because it gives families a digital safety net that’s essential in the digital age,” she added.</p>\n<h3>Praise for HMD X1 On-Device Control</h3>\n<p>Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C., cautioned that as the HMD X1 rolls out, it is crucial to consider the privacy implications of some of its features, like parental tracking and remote access.</p>\n<p>“While these tools offer parents valuable oversight, regulations must ensure that privacy protections are built in from the start,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“A child’s understanding of privacy evolves as they get older, making it essential that safeguards grow alongside them and do not overburden them as they mature and are able to handle less parental oversight,” she continued. “Ensuring users are aware of these implications will be key to fostering responsible and informed use of the device.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Ambrose praised the use of on-device controls by HMD. “Device-level parental controls make it easier for parents and children alike to have a more seamless experience, making sure both apps and websites accessed on a device are child-appropriate — a feature app store level verification lacks.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Huddleston, a technology policy research fellow at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank, contends that the market has generally responded to parents’ concerns over their kids’ use of smartphones.</p>\n<p>“We have seen the market respond with various companies offering kid-safe devices that feature significant parental controls, as well as various levels of the tech ecosystem from ISPs and app stores to social media platforms offering a range of solutions to fit parents’ needs,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“This shows that the market continues to respond to demands for more options for parents and young people, but also that such choices are not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “In this way, having a variety of options for parents to find what best fits their needs for each child is preferable to many of the restrictive policy approaches that would also impact the speech and privacy rights of users of all ages.”</p>\n<p><em>The images featured in this article are credited to HMD.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>This AI-feeding frenzy reminds me more and more of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, but with less focus on overpaying employees. As it was then, the core issue now is companies screaming that their AI is better, but most buyers are still not well enough informed or trained to deploy AI effectively.</p>\n<p>One of the big problems DeepSeek seemed to address out of the box is that quality is important in an AI. What makes DeepSeek interesting is that rather than glossing over that problem, it addressed it up front, resulting in what appears to be both a cheaper and better AI alternative.</p>\n<p>It is also fascinating that because DeepSeek was blocked from using Nvidia’s current top AI technologies, its developers optimized the model to work better on older Nvidia technology. The result appears to be 94% cost savings in creating the model.</p>\n<p>These cost savings have improved performance while reducing expenses. The trade-off is the typical security concern and potential model corruption by the Chinese government, although China may simply be using a filter that blocks unacceptable queries and doesn’t corrupt the core AI.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss AI-wars this week, with a focus on DeepSeek. We’ll close with my Product of the Week from Samsung, which is arguably the most premium non-foldable phone on the market and a showcase of Qualcomm’s latest processor.</p>\n<h3>DeepSeek: It’s Good. But…</h3>\n<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve heard of DeepSeek. Its entry into the market <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/chinese-ai-app-deepseek-rattles-tech-markets-179551.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tanked Nvidia stock</a> last week (even though many argue it shouldn’t have done that) and put OpenAI on notice that there is a new AI sheriff in town from China.</p>\n<p>I’ve been arguing for some time that the industry’s huge mistake was focusing more on speed than quality and accuracy because AIs have become increasingly unreliable over time. What DeepSeek did differently was build in an AI quality check. Instead of just focusing on speed, it puts a lot of effort into quality. The result is impressive.</p>\n<p>The other advantage to DeepSeek is that while it takes around $100 million to spin up a generative AI model like DeepSeek’s, it claims it did it for only $6 million, resulting in a better, cheaper product. Better and cheaper generally result in a win.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is not amused and is suing DeepSeek. However, the lack of cooperation between the U.S. and China makes it unlikely that OpenAI will prevail globally in this effort because China will certainly not support it, which is where DeepSeek is based.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>DeepSeek’s origin in China presents a significant drawback because the Chinese government appears to be interfering with the app. Users are blocked from asking questions about anything China finds sensitive or critical of the government’s actions, past or present.</p>\n<p>While this looks to be a front-end filter, typically, when you place artificial rules on an AI, it will both seek to break them and foster a knowledge base on how to get around the restrictions, which could eventually result in a degradation of accuracy that defines this product.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the U.S. government has issues with TikTok, it will hate DeepSeek because it is more damaging and appears closer to the Chinese government than TikTok. This AI brings up huge domestic privacy and security concerns that easily eclipse those surrounding TikTok, given how an AI is trained and how much more information could be captured from its users.</p>\n<h3>AI Wars</h3>\n<p>The competition is just beginning, as we are already up to our necks in new AI companies at 1,532. Most of these companies will be acquired or will fail, which makes this a really interesting and impressively scary market to work or invest in at the moment, much like it was back in those dot-com days when VCs were throwing money at internet companies until it became clear that many of them weren’t going to make it to revenue, let alone profit.</p>\n<p>This rapid evolution in AI is only a precursor to what we are likely to see in a few years when the first AGI (artificial general intelligence) products show up. Things will likely get crazy because most of the limitations with generative AI will go away, models should drop rapidly in price, and much like the internet is everywhere now, AI will be on the fast path to being everywhere then.</p>\n<p>The amount of money in play is in the trillions of dollars for whoever gets this right first. If Elon Musk is displaced at the top of the rich guy pile, it will likely be by someone as closely connected to AGI as Musk was to electric cars a decade ago. Since AI covers robotics and self-driving vehicles, whoever that is may eclipse Musk quickly once their AGI product sells at scale.</p>\n<p>There is already both a fight for top talent and significant efforts to get AI to develop itself. The latter effort is likely to be the most disruptive because once AI can develop itself, the door opens to an even bigger problem with speed and quality unless that quality aspect is addressed as DeepSeek has.</p>\n<h3>Nvidia Is in Trouble. But…</h3>\n<p>Since the DeepSeek announcement, people have argued that Nvidia is in trouble, so its valuation has taken a beating. However, Nvidia isn’t in trouble because of DeepSeek. It is in trouble because of the U.S. policy preventing Nvidia from selling its best tech to China. As a result, China is figuring out how to use older technology effectively, which has enabled DeepSeek’s impressive, inexpensive, and accurate performance.</p>\n<p>Instead of protecting Nvidia and other U.S. companies, this policy is turning China into a far stronger competitor and effectively locking Nvidia out of competing with Chinese companies. The embargo doesn’t prevent China from getting and reverse engineering a part; they have been doing that for decades with defense technology, and a commercially available part is pretty easy to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gray market</a>. So, the embargo only creates the illusion of security and limits Nvidia from protecting its IP more effectively.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>DeepSeek would likely perform even better on Nvidia’s <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/nvidia-blackwell-is-one-hot-processor-179476.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blackwell</a> AI GPU, which is significantly more efficient and powerful than the older hardware it currently runs on.</p>\n<p>Nvidia should be allowed to compete for this opportunity. However, since it’s blocked, China is successfully figuring out how to move beyond Blackwell and eventually will figure out a way to move beyond Nvidia. It’s not what they want to do because they recognize Nvidia has better technology; it is what they are being made to do by what I view as a foolish U.S. policy that is creating a competitive problem for them.</p>\n<p>If this doesn’t get fixed, the next AI wave will likely break out of China, which, thanks to DeepSeek, may already be happening.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Who Will Win the Global AI Race?</h3>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>With the launch of DeepSeek, the AI-wars have kicked off, but this is just the opening salvo. It’s an impressive opening move that gives the world a heads-up that Chinese companies are more than willing to compete despite technology sanctions that appear to be hurting U.S. companies and consumers (the Chinese EVs are now leading that market) more than they are hurting China’s prospects.</p>\n<p>If the U.S. doesn’t step up to this competition more aggressively by helping rather than hindering U.S. tech companies, it is increasingly likely that China will eventually emerge as the stronger AI competitor (which it may be doing right now), and to the new victor will go the AI spoils.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra front and back view with S Pen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-300x114.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-768x292.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Samsung</p>\n<p>While I prefer foldable phones, most people still opt for traditional single-screen devices. The <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uztexaa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is a technology powerhouse based on Qualcomm’s best processor, the Snapdragon 8 Elite. You can pre-order it now, and it will be available by Friday in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The S25 Ultra is an expensive phone at $1,300. Right now, there’s a sale that makes the 512GB upgrade free, and you can get up to $900 off if you have a relatively current smartphone or tablet to trade in.</p>\n<p>It’s sleeker than its predecessor, with a bigger, brighter, and tougher display. It also allows actions across multiple apps. Its 50 MP camera is amazing, and its AI will work out of the box (Apple’s AI lagged in its latest phone announcement). Some iPhone users who have tested this product found it <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">better</a> than their Apple phones, which is high praise.</p>\n<p>The ability to span apps with AI can be very useful. For instance, you can look up a date for a coming event, put that event on your calendar, and send details to whoever is going with you with a single prompt. This feature continues to make me wonder if separate apps will even be a thing in the future since this phone can seamlessly move between apps using agentic AI to complete complex tasks like the one just mentioned.</p>\n<p>While the phone has some interesting noise cancellation features, early testing has been mixed, suggesting there may be a learning curve to getting the tech to work properly or the need for a patch, which is not unusual for a brand-new advanced feature. The phone comes in several colors. I like the Titanium Jetblack (pictured above with the S pen) the best.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is as much a showcase of Qualcomm’s advanced technology as it is of Samsung’s. It is arguably one of, if not the best, premium phones on the market and my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

However, the scale is worrisome,” observed Thomas Richards, a network and red team practice director at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>, an applications security company in Burlington, Mass.</p>\n<p>“Depending on the type of device compromised, the attackers could leverage their access to disable internet access to the organization, disrupt networks communicating or facilitate their own access inside the network,” Richards told TechNewsWorld. “The attack, even if unsuccessful in gaining access to the devices, can cause harm by attempting too many login attempts and having valid accounts locked out.”</p>\n<p>Patrick Tiquet, vice president for security and architecture at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a Chicago-based password management and online storage company, explained that brute force attacks are significant because they exploit weak or reused passwords, one of the most persistent vulnerabilities in cybersecurity.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Beyond immediate data loss, these breaches can disrupt operations, damage an organization’s reputation, and erode customer trust — leading to long-term financial and security consequences,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Erich Kron, a security awareness advocate at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla., added that the source of these attacks is millions of smaller devices spread around the globe, making them extremely difficult to defend against.</p>\n<p>“Many consumers have old and outdated devices in their homes connecting to the internet,” Kron told TechNewsWorld. “These vulnerable devices are being exploited and used to drive cyberattacks like this.”</p>\n<p>“Traditional approaches such as geoblocking and disallowing large blocks of IP addresses could actually block legitimate web traffic, costing some organizations sales and appearing as if the website is down to potential customers,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Credential-Based Attacks Overwhelm Defenses</h3>\n<p>Kris Bondi, CEO and co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mimoto.ai\">Mimoto</a>, a threat detection and response company in San Francisco, asserted that the campaign exposed by Shadowserver highlights the vulnerability of credentials, even at security and infrastructure organizations.</p>\n<p>“Brute force attacks are automated, so they’re implemented at scale,” Bondi told TechNewsWorld. “It’s not a question of if they can get in with this approach. The question is how many times the organization will be penetrated this way, and will the security team know when it happens.”</p>\n<p>Akamai’s Maynard explained: “Attackers no longer need to sit at a keyboard guessing passwords. They deploy massive botnets that can test thousands of credentials in minutes.”</p>\n<p>“Using an attack called password spraying, attackers can use a known username or email address and pair it with tens of thousands of the most common passwords with software that will then try to log into various exposed devices,” added KnowBe4’s Kron. “With several million devices available to be attempting these logins, the success rate is liable to be high.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Bondi noted that the number and size of brute force attacks are rising. “Automation and generative AI have made it easier to implement this type of attack,” she said.</p>\n<p>“They are hitting the large vulnerability that credentials represent,” she continued. “The attackers know that if they send enough attacks, some percentage will get through. In the meantime, security teams are overwhelmed and aren’t able to address all the attacks in real time, particularly without additional context.”</p>\n<p>The explosion of internet-connected devices and the continued use of weak credentials also contribute to increased brute force attacks.</p>\n<p>“With remote work, smart devices, and cloud adoption, more organizations rely on edge security devices that must be accessible from the internet,” Maynard said. “This makes them natural targets.”</p>\n<p>“Despite years of warnings,” he added, “many companies still use default or weak passwords, especially on infrastructure devices.”</p>\n<h3>AI’s Role in Cyberattack Defense and Prevention</h3>\n<p>While artificial intelligence contributes to the rise in brute force attacks, it may also foil them. “AI has the potential to be a game-changer in defending against brute force and credential stuffing attacks,” Maynard said.</p>\n<p>He noted that security teams are using AI-driven solutions to detect anomalies, analyze behavior, and automate responses to attacks.</p>\n<p>“AI is very good at spotting anomalies and patterns. Therefore, AI can be very useful at looking at attempted logins, finding a pattern, and hopefully suggesting ways to filter the traffic,” Kron explained.</p>\n<p>Jason Soroko, senior vice president of product at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\">Sectigo</a>, a global digital certificate provider, acknowledged that AI could help defenses by detecting anomalous login patterns and throttling suspicious activity in real time, but advised that strong authentication be prioritized first.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“While strong authentication needs identity management to scale and digital certificates and other strong asymmetric form factors need provisioning and lifecycle management, they can yield very strong security benefits,” Soroko told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>However, Bondi predicted AI will eventually vacate the need for credentials. “AI enables combining anomaly detection with advanced pattern matching to recognize specific people, not credentials, with significantly lower rates of false positives,” she said.</p>\n<p>AI can also help deliver context with alerts, which will enable security teams to prioritize and respond faster to true alerts while reducing false positives, she added.</p>\n<p>“The expectation is that in the near future, AI will also be able to help predict intent based on specific actions and techniques of an attack,” Bondi observed. “While LLMs aren’t capable of this yet, they could be within a few quarters.”</p>\n",

Companies like Huawei and others are investing heavily in domestic GPU and AI chip development, driven by both commercial ambitions and a desire for technological self-reliance. Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions, Chinese companies are highly motivated to create competitive alternatives to Western technology, including Nvidia’s products.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Quantum Leap?</h3>\n<p>Nvidia’s increased focus on quantum computing, highlighted by the announcement of its new research center, represents a potentially transformative shift for the company. While still in its early stages, quantum computing holds the promise of revolutionizing computation and solving problems that are intractable for classical computers.</p>\n<p>However, Nvidia is entering a field with already established players. Companies like IBM, Google, and numerous startups are actively pursuing quantum computing research and development. China is also making significant investments in this area, viewing it as a strategic technology for future economic and technological leadership. Other companies with compelling quantum efforts include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rigetti Computing</li>\n<li>Honeywell Quantum Solutions</li>\n<li>IonQ</li>\n<li>PsiQuantum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nvidia’s expertise in accelerated computing could give it an advantage in developing hybrid quantum-classical systems, but it faces stiff competition from these established players.</p>\n<h3>Gaming Takes Back Seat at GTC</h3>\n<p>Another notable aspect of GTC 2025 was the relative lack of emphasis on gaming.</p>\n<p>In the past, GTC was a significant event for showcasing the latest advancements in gaming technology, with a strong focus on graphics performance and new gaming experiences. However, gaming took a backseat to AI and data center technologies this year.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The absence of significant announcements related to AI-powered non-player characters (NPCs) in games was conspicuous. While AI has the potential to revolutionize gaming by creating more dynamic, realistic, and engaging virtual characters, this area did not seem to be a major focus at GTC 2025.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Nvidia is undoubtedly at a pivotal moment. The company’s leadership in AI hardware has propelled it to unprecedented success, but it cannot afford to rest on its laurels. To maintain its position and capitalize on the full potential of AI, Nvidia must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Demonstrate Real-World Impact:</strong> Focus on showcasing how its technology is being used to solve practical problems and drive tangible benefits across industries.</li>\n<li><strong>Embrace the Application Layer:</strong> Go beyond simply providing the hardware and play a more active role in enabling the development of innovative AI applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Navigate the Competitive Landscape:</strong> Aggressively address the challenges posed by rising competitors like AMD and China’s growing technological prowess.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategically Pursue New Frontiers:</strong> While exploring promising areas like quantum computing is essential, Nvidia must ensure that these efforts complement, rather than distract from, its core focus on AI.</li>\n<li><strong>Remember Its Roots:</strong> While the company has expanded far beyond its gaming origins, Nvidia should not completely abandon this market, as it remains an important source of innovation and a key driver of technological advancement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GTC 2025 underscored Nvidia’s continued leadership in AI hardware but also highlighted the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. To thrive in the long term, Nvidia must remain focused, demonstrate the practical power of AI, and avoid devolving into a company that merely touts speeds and feeds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\"></p>\n<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X9-14-Aura-Edition.jpg\" alt=\"ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition (14ʺ Intel) Laptop\" width=\"700\" height=\"645\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X9-14-Aura-Edition.jpg 700w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X9-14-Aura-Edition-300x276.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></p>\n<p>Photo by Author</p>\n<p>The Lenovo <a href=\" https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx9/thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/len101t0110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition</a> represents a change of direction from traditional ThinkPad design, offering a modern, ultraportable take on the business laptop.

I felt it was covering up problems rather than addressing them in the early 2000s. When I pointed that out, my life was threatened, one of my pets was stolen (and allegedly killed), and I resigned from Forrester, which turned out to be a good thing.</p>\n<p>I did go to war for a bit, but I also respected that the legitimate leaders of Linux calmed everyone down. I lived, and I was stronger for the experience — and I really didn’t enjoy working for Forrester in the first place.</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve come to respect Linux as a true power and companies like Red Hat as legitimate providers of powerful open-source solutions that were surprisingly high-performing and robust. Even Microsoft, over this period, came to respect and embrace Linux; more recently, it has become the unsung hero of the AI revolution.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/linux-cubics.jpg\" alt=\"Linux operating system\" width=\"1000\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/linux-cubics.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/linux-cubics-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/linux-cubics-768x407.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>In the whirlwind of AI advancements, one foundational element often remains in the background, yet its impact is undeniable: Linux. Under the steadfast leadership of Jim Zemlin at The Linux Foundation — who spoke at the Intel event and triggered this Product of the Week showcase — this open-source operating system has quietly become the bedrock upon which the most cutting-edge AI technologies are built.</p>\n<p>While the recent market tremors caused by DeepSeek’s emergence momentarily shook investor confidence, a more profound narrative is unfolding. This is a story of open-source collaboration, strategic foresight, and the democratization of AI. Linus Torvalds, the visionary behind Linux, continues to contribute his brilliance, albeit with the autonomy that fosters true innovation.</p>\n<h4>Linux Powers the Future of AI</h4>\n<p>The shift toward inference, as AI transitions from research labs to mainstream applications, underscores the practical, real-world relevance of Linux. Its flexibility and robustness make it an ideal platform for deploying AI models at scale. Sam Altman’s announcement of a forthcoming open-source model from OpenAI further solidifies this trend, highlighting the growing recognition that open collaboration fuels rapid progress.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>DeepSeek’s impressive capabilities are a testament to the long-term strategic vision of embracing open-source technology. While some may perceive China’s rapid advancements as a competitive threat, it’s essential to recognize that its approach is largely rooted in internal competition and a deep understanding of open-source principles, many of which were learned from the United States. The intense competition within China’s tech sector, coupled with a focus on open source, has propelled them forward.</p>\n<p>It’s a misconception to view open source as a barrier to competitive advantage. In today’s interconnected world, it’s a powerful vehicle for achieving it. Intel’s decisive victory over Sun Microsystems’ proprietary platforms was largely attributed to its embrace of open-source strategies. Even Apple, a company synonymous with proprietary ecosystems, relies heavily on open-source software.</p>\n<h4>The Engine of Innovation</h4>\n<p>The reality is that most of the code underpinning modern products and services is derived from open-source projects. With its vast community and continuous development, Linux stands at the forefront of this movement. It’s the invisible force driving innovation, enabling developers to build upon a solid foundation and accelerating the pace of technological advancement.</p>\n<p>Under Jim Zemlin’s guidance, The Linux Foundation has cultivated an ecosystem that fosters collaboration, transparency, and shared progress. It’s a testament to the power of collective intelligence, where contributions from individuals and organizations around the globe coalesce into a robust and ever-evolving platform.</p>\n<p>As AI continues to shape our world, Linux will remain an indispensable component, quietly powering the next generation of breakthroughs. Its open-source nature ensures accessibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement, making it the ideal foundation for a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into our lives.</p>\n<p>The Linux story is one of shared success, a testament to the power of open collaboration, and a reminder that the most profound innovations often arise from collective effort, so it’s my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The Cevaton 15.6″ Laptop Triple Screen Extender, with its multiple configurations, is a versatile productivity accessory — provided it is compatible with your laptop.</p>\n<p>This screen extender is a novel idea. Its adjustable metal frame lets you position your laptop between twin screens. The adaptable monitor stand can be contorted into various positions to meet almost any workplace or home office need.</p>\n<p>The design options provide 11 screen orientations, including stacked, single-screen, and folding modes. Beyond the traditional side-by-side setup, options include landscape and portrait modes. More modes exist depending on whether you need to view one or both added displays in vertical or horizontal orientations.</p>\n<p>Yet another user scenario lets you mirror an image across two or all three mirrored screens. This trick is handy, as you can display a mirrored image in vertical or horizontal orientation while you work on a third panel to read related text or create content. You no longer need to use two separate computers as a workaround solution.</p>\n<p>Other configuration modes let you mount the two extended monitors back-to-back to view one screen while others sit across a conference table to share their own view. Arranging the two extender monitors atop the laptop screen gives you a long-form view from top to bottom.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Cevaton-Laptop-Triple-Screen-Extender-configurations.jpg\" alt=\"Cevaton 15.6-inch Laptop Screen Extender with Stacked, Single Screen, and Folding Modes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Cevaton-Laptop-Triple-Screen-Extender-configurations.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Cevaton-Laptop-Triple-Screen-Extender-configurations-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Cevaton-Laptop-Triple-Screen-Extender-configurations-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The Cevaton 15.6″ Laptop Screen Extender offers multiple configurations, including stacked, single-screen, and folding modes for versatile display setups.(Image Credit: Cevaton)</p>\n<p>All of these combinations have viewing angle schemes based on 90-degree vertical rotation and 235-degree horizontal rotation, a multi-function configuration button, and dual speakers in each monitor. These options surpass traditional dual-monitor setups, which often require multiple video card ports or docking stations.</p>\n<h3>Setup Challenges and Cable Compatibility</h3>\n<p>My two workplace desktop computers are tethered to secondary monitors. Once set up, cables remain connected for trouble-free use. Similarly, my cadre of laptops and tablets with much smaller screens are paired with a single portable laptop-sized secondary monitor.</p>\n<p>An optional power plug and an HDMI cable are all that is required for a speedy grab-and-go connection. For specialized projects, I endure the hassle of attaching two laptop secondary screens via a docking station, as most laptops can only handle a two-screen setup.</p>\n<p>So, the ability to add matching laptop monitors with connecting cables sans a third-party docking device is an enticing proposition. The setback occurs when the cables Cevaton supplies are unsuitable for every variation of ports built into laptops.</p>\n<h3>Cable Limitations and Workarounds</h3>\n<p>The Cevaton monitors have the same combination of ports: two fully functional USB-C ports and one HDMI port. Depending on the laptop, setting up the connections is not simple plug-and-play.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer includes two cables, one with a standard HDMI plug (for the laptop connection) and one with a mini-plug (for the extended monitor). A pair of included USB Type-C cables is provided for laptops without HDMI support.</p>\n<p>Also included is a set of cables with a USB Type-A plug on one end and a fully USB Type-C plug on the other end. This cable and plug combination can solve connection issues, provided the laptop supports fully functional Type-C features.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>On some of my gear, the device only had one HDMI or other suitable port, leaving nowhere to connect the second Cevaton screen. In oddball cases, the connectors fit, but some glitch in the OS circuitry prevented the video signal from reaching the additional monitors.</p>\n<p>I found that trial and error often was the only way to resolve a setup issue. Potential snags include matching a Type-C USB to a Display Port (DP) connection or HDMI with a USB-Type B or Type-C port. I even ran into a case where the only USB Type-A port and cable combination did not handle video signals well.</p>\n<p>Some situations may require more than one type of cable and connector. For instance, a USB-A cable will also be needed to power the screen extender when connecting with HDMI. A separate power plug is not included.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting Connection Issues</h3>\n<p>Connection issues on some laptops resulted from different hardware specs. I have numerous test laptops, ranging in age and hardware specs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, video and audio ports and plugs are not as standardized as USB type A/B/C, which guarantees plug-and-play. On some laptops, I could connect only one monitor.</p>\n<p>The tiny power button on the monitors doubles as the brightness and contrast adjustment control. It is sensitive to finger movement, which can sometimes cause the brightness control to be too low, making the monitor appear not to be working. The trick is to long press the power button for five seconds to reset the screen brightness.</p>\n<h3>Product Features</h3>\n<p>The 15.6″ portable monitors each weigh 2.1 pounds. The metal frame and rotating arms add several more pounds. The entire setup is easily carried in an included bag.</p>\n<p>A circular connector attaches to the extender monitors at the end of each supporting arm that slides onto the frame. The foldable metal frame provides 235-degree rotation. The standing frame for the dual monitors opens/closes to accommodate 13″ to 17.3″ laptops.</p>\n<p>The monitors deliver 120% sRGB FHD IPS 1080P with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 Pixels, providing a wider view with more vivid colors and a more comfortable viewing experience.</p>\n<p>Multi-function keys let you customize settings such as brightness, volume, contrast, and other parameters for each screen according to your preferences.</p>\n<h3>Pricing and Device Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The Cevaton 15.6″ Laptop Triple Screen Extender was initially listed on Cevaton’s website for $500 and reduced to $399. It is currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7LQPP69?th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listed on Amazon</a> for $299.</p>\n<p>These portable monitors are compatible with Windows, Android, and ChromeOS devices, as well as MacBooks with the M1/M2/M3 Pro or Max chips — but not with the entry-level M1/M2/M3 chips. They also work with Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cevaton.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cevaton website</a> provides more detailed laptop listings and can be used to confirm if the product is compatible with your laptop model.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Cevaton’s dual monitor extensions are an unusual product that offers more use-case solutions than many people need. The frame and connectors are very sturdy and easy to assemble, disassemble, and carry with your laptop.</p>\n<p>If you confirm that your computer is compatible before purchasing, you should not have difficulties connecting both monitors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><i></i> Suggest a Review</h3>\n<p>Is there a tech product or application you’d like to suggest for review?

      "content": "<p>During the dawn of the PC era, a single program was touted as the “killer app” that fired the market for personal computers. That program was a spreadsheet called VisiCalc. Now, another spreadsheet could have a similar impact on the AI market.</p>\n<p>Announced Monday, along with US$4.3 million in venture funding, the new spreadsheet, cloud-based <a href=\"https://sourcetable.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sourcetable</a>, promises to use AI to democratize data analysis for everyone. While 750 million people use spreadsheets every day, only 20% know how to use basic analytical functions, according to Sourcetable.</p>\n<p>It explained in a statement that the AI spreadsheet eliminates the technical barrier that has plagued spreadsheets since their inception. Users simply tell the spreadsheet what they want done through natural language commands, and Sourcetable’s AI does the work for them. Instructions can be made via keyboard or through a hands-free voice control mode.</p>\n<p>Sourcetable added that the spreadsheet’s autopilot mode can complete a wide range of complex tasks that typically require advanced spreadsheet knowledge, including creating and editing financial models, generating spreadsheet templates, building pivot tables, cleaning data, creating charts and graphs, editing formatting, enriching data, and analyzing entire workbooks.</p>\n<p>In addition, the AI can understand data context without requiring users to pre-select ranges, interpret multiple ranges across different tabs, work with messy data, and seek human clarification when instructions are unclear.</p>\n<h3>Smart AI Analyst On Demand</h3>\n<p>“We make it easier for executives and managers to have a lot more digital intelligence at their disposal to do tasks,” said Sourcetable CEO Eoin McMillan. “We also make it easier for junior employees or recent grads to upskill very, very quickly.”</p>\n<p>“And we make it easier for people, whether they’re in marketing or sales or accounting or finance, to do both complex workflows, which may not have been possible before based on their skills and training, as well as save them a lot of time on simple workflows, which can be manually intensive,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Sourcetable-founders.jpg\" alt=\"Eoin McMillan, CEO, and Andrew Grosser, CTO, are the co-founders of Sourcetable.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Sourcetable-founders.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Sourcetable-founders-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Sourcetable-founders-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Eoin McMillan, CEO, and Andrew Grosser, CTO, are the co-founders of Sourcetable. Photo by Sophia Morel.</p>\n<p>McMillan explained that partnering with AI is like having a brilliant digital analyst on demand. “It allows you to do harder things easier and time-consuming tasks faster. Workflows that took hours can take minutes.”</p>\n<p>Chris Sorenson, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.phoneburner.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PhoneBurner</a>, a power dialer SaaS company in Seattle, maintained that bringing AI into spreadsheets is a logical evolution. “Spreadsheets are powerful, but traditional spreadsheets require a high level of expertise to manipulate large datasets, build formulas, and extract insights,” he told TechNewsWorld. “As someone with a sales background, I speak to this from experience.”</p>\n<p>“With AI, we are seeing a shift — people can ask natural-language questions and get real answers without needing to be a data analyst,” he said. “That’s a major productivity unlock, especially for teams that don’t have dedicated data pros on hand.”</p>\n<p>“I do think Sourcetable’s idea that ‘everyone can become an analyst’ has merit,” he continued. “It lowers the barrier to entry for data-driven decision-making. But there’s still a learning curve in understanding what the AI is doing behind the scenes — and there’s always a risk of misinterpreting data if you take results at face value without understanding the context.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“I really believe this could be similar to what VisiCalc did for PCs,” he asserted. “If AI can better turn spreadsheets into something smarter and more accessible, it could become a gateway to broader AI adoption across departments, but time will tell.”</p>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, agreed. “Just as VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3 brought computing to a broader audience by solving a practical need for accounting and planning, AI spreadsheets could do the same for AI,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They package powerful capabilities into a familiar interface, making AI accessible to a much wider group of users.”</p>\n<h3>Killer App or Spreadsheet Killer?</h3>\n<p>Robin Patra, head of data, analytics, and AI at a large U.S. contractor that relied heavily on Excel workflows before moving to Sourcetable, maintained that just as VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3 popularized PCs, AI spreadsheets could catalyze mainstream AI adoption.</p>\n<p>“VisiCalc transformed spreadsheets from paper-based ledgers to digital tools, driving Apple II sales,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Similarly, Sourcetable’s ‘self-driving’ interface represents a paradigm shift.”</p>\n<p>“VisiCalc also enabled non-programmers to compute finances,” he added. “Sourcetable empowers non-technical users to execute advanced analytics.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>While Sourcetable could be a killer AI app, it could also be a spreadsheet killer. “AI will likely make spreadsheets as we know them obsolete because it can take direction and potentially create better outcomes without needing the spreadsheet technology to arrive at this better outcome,” explained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Oregon.</p>\n<p>“You just tell the AI what you need, input the data, and then get the improved results,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He cautioned that AI can have accuracy problems even with math. “AI can introduce hard-to-identify errors, making the results unreliable,” he warned.</p>\n<h3>How AI Spreadsheets May Shape the Future</h3>\n<p>“To be clear,” Vena added, “one non-trivial downside is over-reliance on AI-generated output, which may not always be accurate or explainable.”</p>\n<p>“There’s also the risk of reduced skill development in traditional analysis methods and potential privacy concerns when data is processed through AI systems,” he said.</p>\n<p>Sourcetable’s contention that AI can make everyone an analyst needs to be examined critically, he added. “AI can level the playing field by enabling non-experts to run analyses and extract insights,” he noted, “but Sourcetable assumes that AI always delivers useful or correct answers — which isn’t guaranteed. Users still need judgment to interpret results, so like any AI technology, it’s not fail-safe.”</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Sourcetable could influence not only spreadsheet applications but also consumer applications in general. “AI spreadsheets could phase out roles centered on manual data entry, shifting demand toward AI management skills,” Patra said.</p>\n<p>Natural language interfaces could also start to replace traditional GUI-based tools, he added.</p>\n<p>“AI-powered consumer tools like Sourcetable could reshape productivity software,” Vena said. “They may lead to faster decision-making, more empowered individuals, and broader adoption of data-driven thinking.”</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “they also raise issues around data security, job displacement, and trust in automated systems. But putting those issues aside, this has the potential as a real breakthrough that both businesses and mainstream consumers could benefit from.”</p>\n",

AI-generated attacks manipulate Face ID and voice authentication to gain unauthorized access, steal payment details, and bypass traditional security measures, putting both retailers and consumers at increasing risk.</p>\n<p>With 187.5 million people in the U.S. shopping on mobile devices last year, mobile transactions now account for half of all e-commerce sales. But as their popularity grows, so does their appeal to cybercriminals. Biometric authentication, such as iOS Face ID and Android Face Unlock, has long been a cornerstone of mobile security.</p>\n<p>However, deepfake attacks have evolved at an alarming pace. They use AI-generated voices, videos, and facial animations to bypass these defenses, fueling large-scale identity theft, payment fraud, and unauthorized transactions.</p>\n<p>According to <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.appdome.com\">Appdome</a>, a mobile security platform specializing in AI-driven threat defense, cybercriminals increasingly use deepfake biometric bypass techniques to take over accounts, steal sensitive data, and initiate fraudulent transactions.

They can take the lead with autonomous mobile defense strategies.</p>\n<p>If he could give one crucial piece of advice to mobile commerce businesses today on protecting their customers from deepfake subterfuge, it would be to stop the fragmented, piecemeal approach of layering different security and fraud tools into their tech stack and hoping they work together.</p>\n<p>“The only way to truly protect mobile commerce from deepfake fraud and millions of other threat vectors is to shift to a platform-based approach with an AI-native engine at the core,” he told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<h3>Why Mobile Transactions Are Vulnerable to Deepfake Fraud</h3>\n<p>According to Reed, mobile commerce depends on biometric authentication for frictionless user access. Because Face ID, Face Unlock, and voice authentication are now universal features across mobile banking and retail apps, attackers have spent years probing for vulnerabilities. AI-generated deepfakes now provide them with a powerful tool to impersonate users, take over accounts, and commit fraud at scale.</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals leverage AI-powered deepfakes to bypass facial recognition, voice authentication, and identity verification. They generate deepfake videos and images to trick Face ID, often using stolen social media photos to create synthetic identities for fraudulent Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Voice cloning technology enables attackers to impersonate users in phone-based banking authentication, making it easier to gain unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>As these tactics become more advanced and widely available, traditional biometric defenses are proving insufficient to stop the growing threat of AI-driven fraud.</p>\n<p>Reed observed that consumers’ misconceptions about biometric security drive a wedge between their trust and cyber realities. While many still trust biometric authentication as foolproof, deepfake attacks are changing the game.</p>\n<p>“Hyper-realistic biometric spoofs can now bypass Face ID, voice authentication, and other biometric security measures. To maintain trust, mobile businesses must strengthen their security with AI-driven deepfake protections, liveness detection, and anti-spoofing technology,” he urged.</p>\n<h3>Updating Policies and Regulations for AI-Powered Fraud</h3>\n<p>Unlike traditional security, autonomous defense operates with continuous vigilance, adapting in real time using AI, machine learning, and large-scale threat intelligence. This proactive approach detects and stops deepfake fraud — and millions of other attacks and threats — before it happens, ensuring mobile businesses stay ahead of evolving AI-powered threats instead of reacting to them.</p>\n<p>This type of mobile defense platform integrates security directly into mobile apps during development. It delivers real-time, in-app, on-device protection against evolving threats and continuously monitors and responds to new attacks throughout the mobile app lifecycle.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“AI-powered fraud and threats aren’t slowing down, and neither should your defense. Move from reactive security and fraud protection to AI-native protection built directly into your mobile app,” Reed urged.</p>\n<p>Existing regulations were not designed for AI-powered fraud. Compliance policies like KYC and PCI-DSS predate deepfake AI attacks, leaving dangerous gaps in fraud prevention, he reasoned. Cybercriminals are now using AI to manipulate biometric authentication, bypass identity verification, and commit large-scale fraud, exploiting the fact that regulations haven’t caught up.</p>\n<p>“The industry can’t wait for policymakers to act. Mobile businesses must take the lead by deploying AI-native defenses now, ensuring deepfake attacks are detected and blocked in real-time before they cause harm,” Reed said about deploying a better option.</p>\n<h3>Appdome’s Deepfake Defense for Mobile Security</h3>\n<p>In late February, Appdome announced an extension to its Account Takeover Protection suite with 30 new dynamic defense plugins for Deep Fake Detection in Android and iOS apps. These plugins better ensure the integrity of Apple Face ID, Google Face Recognition, and third-party face and voice recognition services against AI-generated and other deepfake attacks.</p>\n<p>“The mobile economy depends on the integrity of facial recognition, Face ID, and other biometric authentication methods to reduce friction,” said Eric Newcomer, principal analyst and CTO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://intellyx.com\">Intellyx</a>. “However, attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass biometric authentication,” he noted.</p>\n<p>Appdome’s approach provides mobile businesses with granular detection and control defenses to stop these attacks inside the mobile app, he explained. This prevents attack data from passing to other systems, combating account takeover and open directory forgery attacks quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>According to Appdome, deepfake attacks generate hyper-realistic, adversarial replications or manipulations that can fool facial and voice verification systems. Sometimes, attackers use virtual cameras to inject pre-recorded or live video streams into the facial recognition process. Other times, image buffer attacks manipulate face data processing in real time to bypass detection processes.</p>\n<p>Hyper-realistic biometric spoofs can bypass Face ID, voice authentication, and other biometric security measures. Reed insisted that mobile businesses must strengthen their security with AI-driven deepfake protections, liveness detection, and anti-spoofing technology to maintain trust.</p>\n<p>“Everyone, from mobile app developers to enterprises to Face ID and facial recognition vendors, is struggling with the technical challenges of detecting AI-generated deepfakes and Face ID bypass techniques,” said Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome.</p>\n<p>“While no one can stop the creation of deepfakes, we’ve succeeded in stopping their use inside mobile applications, and we’re making our innovations available to mobile app developers and face recognition vendors alike,” he offered.</p>\n<h3>How Mobile Businesses Can Fight Deepfake Fraud</h3>\n<p>The future of mobile commerce is at risk if cybersecurity cannot stop the deepfake damage. AI-powered fraud and deepfake attacks are growing more sophisticated, making them harder to detect. In the coming years, cybercriminals will continue to target biometric authentication, identity verification, and financial transactions with enhanced e-commerce theft powered by increasingly advanced AI-generated attacks, warned Reed.</p>\n<p>He recommended the following measures for mobile commerce platforms to combat deepfake fraud:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate AI-native deepfake detection directly into their mobile apps</li>\n<li>Enforce real-time, on-device biometric verification</li>\n<li>Monitor emerging attack vectors and continuously adapt to new threats</li>\n<li>Deploy autonomous mobile defenses that detect and neutralize AI-generated fraud before damage occurs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implementing these strategies can help them stay ahead of evolving threats and protect businesses and consumers from fraud.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Open-source software has become a prime target in the escalating wave of cybersecurity threats. As attacks grow more sophisticated, the open-source community is racing to close critical security gaps and stop malicious code before it spreads.</p>\n<p>With open-source code used in most commercial software, infection risks are rampant across most industries. It is indispensable and dangerously neglected, remarked Jason Soroko, senior fellow at certificate lifecycle management firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\">Sectigo</a>.</p>\n<p>“With 86% of codebases harboring vulnerabilities and a tripling in open source file counts over four years, modern applications have increased their attack surfaces without adequate oversight,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>He urged security teams to overhaul their strategies. Traditional package scanning misses over 20% of dependencies, exposing blind spots introduced by alternate coding practices and AI tools.</p>\n<p>Soroko says several recent reports offer more than just a wake-up call. They issue a mandate for proactive governance.</p>\n<h3>Efforts to Tackle Open Source Threat Spike</h3>\n<p>Live patching and Linux security firm TuxCare’s 2025 Enterprise Linux and Open Source Landscape Report — available as a <a href=\"https://tuxcare.com/downloadables/enterprise-linux-opensource-landscape-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free download</a> — bears out that prognosis. It uncovered three significant trends this year that sparked a wake-up call for security experts and software users on all platforms.</p>\n<p>TuxCare Chief Revenue Officer Michael Canavan warned that there is a clear discrepancy between the perception of vulnerability levels and actual threats.</p>\n<p>“The report’s numerous other findings also paint a picture of an open source and enterprise Linux space that’s experiencing ongoing innovation and disruption alongside ongoing security challenges,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>This 62-page report, released in February, was followed by another study showing how widespread malicious code has grown and is easily used against any target. Also released in February, researchers at application security firm Apiiro detected and analyzed thousands of malicious code instances in software repositories and packages, with new ones emerging daily.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apiiro.com/blog/malicious-code-campaign-github-repo-confusion-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> described how millions of GitHub repositories were cloned and infected with malware loaders, according to Matan Giladi, a security researcher at Apiiro. Obfuscation is key in blocking attack detection.</p>\n<p>“Obfuscation methods evolve continuously. Known obfuscation methods are numerous, each taking multiple forms, making detection and separation from benign code very challenging,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<h3>Gaps in Perception Undermine Linux Security</h3>\n<p>One major revelation in the TuxCare report is the misalignment between security professionals’ perceptions. There is a significant disconnect between security professionals’ perceptions of vulnerability levels and the true threat landscape.</p>\n<p>Roughly half of the respondents believed vulnerability volumes remained stable in 2024 compared to 2023. However, data shows a 25% increase overall and a staggering 12-fold increase in Linux-specific vulnerabilities. This underestimation can negatively impact security strategies, budget allocation, and incident response planning.</p>\n<p>“Organizations must move beyond reactive thinking and implement continuous vulnerability scanning, threat intelligence integration, and transparent reporting. You can’t secure what you don’t accurately understand. The data show too many teams are still flying blind.” Canavan said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The report noted a significant drop in confidence in open-source supply chain security — from 23.81% to 12.31%. This decline likely reflects increased awareness of supply chain attacks, such as the XZ backdoor incident, which had a broad impact and led 70% of organizations to review their open-source supply chain processes.</p>\n<p>Canavan admitted that trust in open-source supply chains is eroding, and rightfully so. Organizations must adopt a zero-trust mindset with practices like Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) enforcement, routine dependency audits, and verified source code provenance.</p>\n<p>Open source isn’t the problem; unverified and unmanaged consumption is. He urged treating software supply chain security with the same rigor as physical infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>More Key Findings in the TuxCare Cyber Report</h3>\n<p>The reliance on full automation in security processes dropped from 14.48% to 2.56%. This trend indicates a growing recognition of the necessity of human oversight alongside automation for effective security.</p>\n<p>“Automation is essential, but it can’t replace judgment. The retreat from full automation reflects a necessary correction,” Canavan noted.</p>\n<p>Human expertise is critical for vulnerability prioritization, patch validation, and incident response. Automation should handle the repetitive and scalable tasks, while humans should handle the ambiguous and strategic ones.</p>\n<p>“The most resilient environments are those where both work in harmony,” he added.</p>\n<p>The <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a> incident and the discovery of the XZ Utils backdoor significantly raised awareness about software supply chain risks. CrowdStrike <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/crowdstrike-outage-to-cost-fortune-500-usd5-4-billion-8683162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> caused direct losses that could reach $5.4 billion to Fortune 500 companies, highlighting the significant financial consequences of security breaches. With 83.6% of respondents aware of the XZ occurrence, the perception of open-source security suffered serious harm.</p>\n<p>Organizations are increasingly adopting AI for cost reduction (rising from 35% to 53%) rather than primarily for innovation (which has declined) — suggesting a maturing view of AI as a practical business tool focused on efficiency.</p>\n<p>“As AI adoption shifts from innovation to cost efficiency, we’ll see growing enterprise demand for lightweight, purpose-built open-source AI tools that offer fast deployment and measurable ROI,” Canavan predicted.</p>\n<p>“This pivot will also likely drive more targeted contributions to projects that optimize compute resources, streamline workflows, and simplify integration into existing enterprise stacks.”</p>\n<h3>New Tools Aim To Detect Malicious Code Early</h3>\n<p>Until now, CISOs had to pay significant costs to defend against malicious code, with organizations often investing hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Apiiro hopes its two solutions, available at Github, change that scenario.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The first, <a href=\"https://github.com/apiiro/malicious-code-ruleset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semgrep rules</a>, detect dynamic code execution and obfuscation patterns found in most malicious code-reported incidents. It includes only rules with low false-positive rates and a strong correlation with malicious code. According to Giladi, this ruleset integrates with any CI/CD pipeline, enabling detection at any stage.</p>\n<p>The second, <a href=\"https://github.com/apiiro/PRevent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prevent</a>, allows real-time monitoring of pull requests, enforcing policies, and triggering workflows. This tool works in conjunction with Semgrep.</p>\n<p>“Existing workflows provide none or minimal coverage for these patterns, and those that do produce a huge amount of false positives,” Giladi said, referring to anti-patterns in malicious code.</p>\n<p>He added that binary analysis tools detect malware in compiled code, and static analysis tools scan for vulnerabilities. However, it neither detects malicious code added to the source code nor its lifecycle.</p>\n<p>“The closest are scanners for malicious code in open source, which might aid researchers but are impractical for organizations due to the high false positives ratio and limited coverage,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Reducing False Positives in Threat Detection</h3>\n<p>Apiiro’s research determined that the identified anti-patterns are rare in benign code. However, they also found some potential scenarios where legitimate code might exhibit these patterns. The company’s approach minimizes false positives.</p>\n<p>According to Giladi, most false positives arise from detections of encoded data. Both are favorites of attackers and a topic with a significant lack of awareness.</p>\n<p>“While it’s agreed that code should be readable, and encoded data is unreadable, many developers rely on outdated practices. Generally, adherence to established coding standards such as Google/Microsoft guidelines eliminates false positives,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Ubiquity of Open Source Raises Risk</h3>\n<p>The recent release of cybersecurity firm Black Duck’s Open Source Security and Risk Analysis (OSSRA) Report — <a href=\"https://www.blackduck.com/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available with a form fill</a> — demonstrated how widespread open source code is. It is so ubiquitous that it can introduce significant risk unless adequately identified and managed.</p>\n<p>The report found that 86% of commercial codebases evaluated contained open-source software vulnerabilities, and 81% contained high- or critical-risk vulnerabilities. Black Duck’s data shows that the number of open-source files in an average application tripled from more than 5,300 in 2020 to more than 16,000 in 2024.</p>\n<p>Additional key findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>90% of audited codebases were found to have open-source components that were more than four years out of date.</li>\n<li>jQuery, a widely used JavaScript library, was the most frequent source of vulnerabilities, with eight of the top 10 high-risk vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Only 77% of dependencies could be identified via package manager scanning, suggesting that other means, including AI coding assistants, introduced the remainder. These blind spots lead to lingering unpatched vulnerabilities, outdated components, and license conflicts.</li>\n<li>97% of the evaluated codebases contained open source, with an average of 911 OSS components found per application. From an industry perspective, the percentages ranged from 100% in the Computer Hardware and Semiconductors, EdTech, and Internet and Mobile Apps sectors to a “low” of 79% for Manufacturing, Industrials, and Robotics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The research findings indicate that adopting open-source software widely poses considerable security challenges. Many commercial codebases exhibit critically risky vulnerabilities, indicating a systemic problem,” said Eric Schwake, director of cybersecurity strategy at API security firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://salt.security/\">Salt Security</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>For decades, Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) operators were in the communications catbird’s seat 22,000 miles above the Earth, but the arrival of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) networks, like Elon Musk’s Starlink, is bringing the Old Guard in satellite com down to terra firma.</p>\n<p>“The proprietary and specialized GEO infrastructure of the past is now weighing down space industry incumbents that find themselves needing to rapidly innovate against mounting competition,” <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abiresearch.com/\">ABI Research</a> Senior Analyst Andrew Cavalier wrote in a recent research report.</p>\n<p>An indicator that innovation is in order is how the financial markets look at the major GEO players. Cavalier pointed out that in February, Moody’s Ratings changed its outlook on satellite operator SES from “stable” to “negative,” which has been attributed to increased competition in the satellite sector, price pressure, and risk of oversupply from LEO networks.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, he continued, European satellite operator Eutelsat OneWeb has seen its market capitalization drop more than 57% during the last six months, and Moody’s has given American Geostationary Earth Orbit operator EchoStar a Caa2 rating and a negative long-term outlook. Cavalier added that another GEO operator, Hughes Network, has been hemorrhaging broadband subscribers, dropping from 1.17 million at the end of 2023 to 869,000 at the end of 2024.</p>\n<p>“If the performance of these companies is coming from only the initial rise of SpaceX’s Starlink, then the full deployment of Project Kuiper and Chinese mega constellations Qianfan (Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST)), Guowang (China SatNet), and Honghu-3 (Hongqing Technology) could signal the end of a GEO era,” he wrote.</p>\n<h3>Low Orbit, High Value</h3>\n<p>Cavalier noted that LEO networks pose several challenges to GEO networks. LEO nets operate in lower orbits — 186 to 800 miles versus 22,000 for GEO nets — so they can offer lower latency links. “That enables more user-friendly applications like streaming, video calling, and gaming, which suffer from GEO connections due to higher latencies,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Service cost is also a rapidly evolving factor, as LEO networks are constantly pushing down service costs to users across verticals, he added.</p>\n<p>LEO networks also constantly launch satellites, which results in the network being updated every two to three years, he continued. “GEO often has much longer procurement processes and satellite lifetime — around 15 years — making those networks more static in comparison,” he said.</p>\n<p>Radiation is also less of a problem for LEO satellites. “LEO operates in a lower radiation environment than GEO,” explained <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/2001925 \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daniel Bliss</a>, a professor at Arizona State University and director of the Center for Wireless Information Systems and Computational Architectures.</p>\n<p>“You can’t quite use the same electronics that you use on Earth for LEO, but pretty close,” he told TechNewsWorld. “When you go into deeper space, you need to put a lot of engineering effort into making sure that the hardware will survive higher radiation levels.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Cavalier noted that GEO satellite networks — unless operating multiple satellites covering different regions — have a fixed region of coverage and service provision, while LEO networks operate on a global basis.</p>\n<p>However, GEO networks can also provide consistent and persistent coverage to entire regions of the Earth. “A single GEO satellite can cover 40% of the Earth’s surface,” John Strand, CEO of Strand Consulting, a consulting firm with a focus on telecom, in Denmark, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He added that because of their higher altitude, GEO satellites are also less exposed to space debris.</p>\n<p>“The big advantage of GEO is those big birds have really big pipes on board, so you can push a lot more data through a GEO network than you can a LEO network,” Jim Dunstan, general counsel of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techfreedom.org/\">TechFreedom</a>, a technology advocacy group in Washington, D.C. told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Cavalier added that GEO networks, over time, are far less capital-intensive businesses than the mass manufacturing model of LEO networks, enabling a lower total cost of ownership to provide basic coverage and connectivity.</p>\n<p>“This enables GEO networks to provide coverage to applications that may not need low latency as a priority, such as IoT devices and low-data rate mobile assets that move in and out of coverage, freeing up LEO capacity to target user applications that demand low latency,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“I really think there’s going to be a very robust market for GEO operators in the internet of things [IoT],” Dunstan said. “It’s going to require them to rethink themselves, what they do and what they have. They have big pipes, but they’re going to have to be better distributed rather than just these single streams going up and down. They’ve never had to do it before, but they’ll have to learn how to do it to stay relevant.”</p>\n<h3>GEO Here to Stay</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://oneweb.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eutelsat OneWeb</a>, the only GEO operator that also has a LEO network, sees a multi-orbit approach as the future of satellite communication. “From our perspective, GEO is complementary to LEO satellites in the way they can offer continuous global connectivity and ultimately, a multi-orbit approach dynamically allocates resources based on demand and specific application requirements,” Eutelsat spokesperson Katie Dowd told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The market is evolving toward multi-orbit systems that use GEO for broad coverage and LEO for high-speed, low-latency applications such as streaming or gaming,” she maintained.</p>\n<p>“In an increasingly connected world, customers are looking for always-on, always-connected, resiliency, redundant connectivity solutions, and this underpins the case for multi-orbit solutions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“GEO satellites may also evolve to focus more on high throughput services — broadcasting, government communications, Earth observation, and weather monitoring — while LEO will address latency-sensitive applications — maritime and aviation, gaming, streaming,” she added. “The integration of GEO and LEO is and will continue to create new market opportunities and expand the capabilities of satellite communications.”</p>\n<p>Whatever direction GEO networks decide to go in the future, it probably won’t include retail broadband. “There’s no way that GEO can compete with LEO in retail broadband,” <a href=\"https://www.bellisario.psu.edu/people/individual/christopher-ali \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christopher Ali</a>, a professor of telecommunications at Penn State University’s Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think the industry will die, but I do think it’s going to pivot away from retail,” he added.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re in the very early stages of the traditional satellite industry’s response to new LEO entrants,” said <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/jay-robbins \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jay Robbins</a>, Americas telecommunications leader for EY, a global professional services company.</p>\n<p>“Hybrid GEO-LEO services, as well as industry consolidation and early pivots, are the first steps in this transformation, but not the last,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“GEO SmallSats are one example of an emerging model that gives more capital efficiency to GEO operators, which I think we’ll see more of in the future,” he added. “Another example is better use of dynamically utilizing satellite capacity. We’re also seeing GEO operators start to rethink their asset and value chain structures.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Researchers at the University of Waterloo’s Cheriton School of Computer Science in Canada found that modifying just 30 lines of code in the Linux kernel could cut data center energy consumption by 30% to 45%.</p>\n<p>Linux dominates data centers, where energy use is a growing concern. A more efficient Linux kernel could also lower operating costs for research institutions relying on Linux-powered servers.</p>\n<p>The researchers presented their findings at ACM Sigmetrics 2024, highlighting the need for a kernel modification and introducing an optimization designed to support a sustainable server room in Waterloo’s upcoming Mathematics 4 building.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t add anything. We just rearranged what is done when, which leads to a much better usage of the data center’s CPU caches. It’s kind of like rearranging the pipeline at a manufacturing plant so that you don’t have people running around all the time,” said Martin Karsten, professor and associate director at Waterloo.</p>\n<h3>Linux Kernel Tweak Enhances Data Center Efficiency</h3>\n<p>Karsten explained that the proposed solution rearranges operations within the Linux networking stack, improving the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking. Their research shows this modification can boost throughput by up to 45% while maintaining tail latency.</p>\n<p>Karsten worked with Joe Damato, a distinguished engineer at edge cloud platform provider <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fastly</a>, to develop a non-intrusive kernel change that improves Linux’s network traffic processing.

He explained that IRQ suspension enhances network performance while maintaining low latency during low-traffic conditions by reducing unnecessary CPU interruptions during high-traffic periods.</p>\n<p>The code research was part of an ongoing project to build a green computer server room in the school’s new mathematics building. Karsten said sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists.</p>\n<p>“All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they’re very picky about how they decide to use it,” Karsten noted. “If they choose to ‘switch on’ our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt-hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the internet could be positively affected by this.”</p>\n<h3>Open Source Community Backs Energy-Saving Fix</h3>\n<p>Ann Schlemmer, CEO of open-source database firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com\">Percona</a>, views code modification as a great example of the power of open source and community contributions.</p>\n<p>“It is well-tested and documented. The overall benefits seem very compelling,” she told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>Jason Soroko, a senior fellow at cybersecurity firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sectigo.com\">Sectigo</a>, agreed that the research was legitimate and from a respected institution that could yield significant, long-term impact. If successful, the update might become integral to Linux and potentially influence other platforms.</p>\n<p>“I would not be surprised if there are many other significant efficiencies to be gained by taking a closer look. By refining how Linux handles ephemeral data, the researchers address privacy, security, and performance concerns,” he told LinuxInsider. “Their approach could streamline data lifecycle management, reducing memory bloat and risk of exposure.”</p>\n<h3>Minor Linux Fix Could Deliver Major Energy Savings</h3>\n<p>Implementing small efficiencies can scale big when implemented across colossal data centers. A network card does not draw the majority of power in a server or networking device. However, modern networking devices can draw a couple of watts per networking interface, offered Jamie Boote, associate principal security consultant at security software firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>.</p>\n<p>A typical data center rack holds about 40 servers, each with at least two networking interfaces. According to Boote, the Ethernet interfaces of a single rack draw 160 watts in total.</p>\n<p>“Reducing the power draw of a data center, which may have hundreds or thousands of racks, would be akin to an energy savings of switching a building from incandescent to more energy efficient LED lighting and be well worth the investment,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>According to Boote, this optimization fixes a part of the kernel written when lower-speed Ethernet interfaces drew a fraction of today’s electrical needs. The networking stack design did not account for the growing power budget required by modern networking interfaces.</p>\n<p>“By changing the priority of how the computers schedule tasks during high bandwidth events, a computer can better deal with networking traffic and prioritize energy expenditure in a way that makes sense for modern hardware and architectures,” he reasoned.</p>\n<h3>Network Performance Trade-Offs</h3>\n<p>Computing currently accounts for about 5% of the world’s daily energy use. Software developers no longer focus on performance efficiency as they once did, whether making open-source or proprietary applications.</p>\n<p>According to intellectual property and technology attorney <a href=\"https://vandykeiplaw.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Raymond Van Dyke</a>, programmers used to handle code execution bottlenecks with fundamental electronic workarounds to maximize efficiency. With the exponential advances in technology, many have lost some of the old efficiency habits.</p>\n<p>“I am not at all surprised that outsiders, looking at existing code and data processing, can make that code more efficient and require less energy consumption in its usage. This is the way it should be,” he told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>The proposed Linux kernel modification selectively defers network interrupt processing, potentially reducing data center energy use by 30% to 45%. However, this optimization isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, advised Ariadne Conill, maintainer of <a href=\"https://alpinelinux.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alpine Linux</a> and distinguished engineer and co-founder at security firm <a href=\"https://edera.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Edera</a>.</p>\n<p>“It requires manual configuration through the ‘ethtool’ utility and is primarily beneficial for large-scale data center operators (hyperscalers) running specific types of network-intensive applications. While promising, the modification comes with important trade-offs,” she told LinuxInsider.</p>\n<p>For instance, it may make network latency less predictable and lead to uneven resource allocation for network-heavy applications.</p>\n<p>“We can view this update as an opt-in feature rather than a default setting change. It’s most suitable for carefully controlled data center environments where these trade-offs can be properly managed,” Conill noted.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AI red teaming — the practice of simulating attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in AI systems — is emerging as a vital security strategy.</p>\n<p>Traditional red teaming focuses on simulating adversarial tactics to identify vulnerabilities in static systems — applications built on predictable coding frameworks. While challenging, these engagements rely on decades of collective experience and a well-understood threat landscape. Artificial intelligence systems, meanwhile, present fundamentally different challenges.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional applications, AI systems are dynamic, adaptive, and often opaque, making vulnerabilities harder to identify. The threats targeting these systems are also unique, ranging from adversarial inputs that manipulate model behavior to malicious modifications of the models themselves. Understanding these differences is critical for securing AI-powered operations.</p>\n<h3>Understanding AI Red Teaming</h3>\n<p>AI red teaming systematically probes AI systems to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits. Like traditional red teams, AI red teams emulate adversarial tactics to uncover weaknesses before they can be exploited. However, the challenges in AI environments are amplified by model complexity, novel attack vectors, and the high stakes of failure.</p>\n<p>Red teaming spans critical areas. Adversarial machine learning (ML) techniques involve crafting inputs to deceive models into making incorrect predictions. Model file security focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in the serialized files that store machine learning models, ensuring they can’t be exploited as vectors for malicious code. Operational security examines risks within AI workflows and supply chains, pinpointing exposure points adversaries might exploit.</p>\n<h3>Why AI Red Teaming Is Critical</h3>\n<p>The adoption of AI has transformed industries, introducing significant risks alongside benefits. Models trained on sensitive data, deployed in distributed environments, or integrated into decision-making processes create a broader attack surface. Adversaries can manipulate inputs through vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs), leading to unintended outputs or actions.</p>\n<p>AI models, often valuable intellectual property, are also vulnerable to theft or sabotage, leading to severe business impacts. Maliciously crafted models can even act as malware, leaking sensitive data when deployed.</p>\n<p>For example, an attacker might embed harmful code within a serialized model file. If a machine learning engineer unknowingly loads the file, the attacker could gain access to sensitive systems. This threat is particularly severe in industries like healthcare and finance, where compromised models could directly impact operations and compliance.</p>\n<h3>Modernizing Red Teaming for AI</h3>\n<p>Traditional cybersecurity measures often fail to address AI-specific threats. Unlike fixed codebases, AI models are dynamic and adaptive, introducing unpredictable vulnerabilities that require innovative testing strategies.</p>\n<p>AI attack vectors often involve reverse engineering or adversarial attacks that undermine predictions. Additionally, tools designed to secure AI systems can sometimes be weaponized for offensive use, requiring a deep understanding of their dual-use capabilities.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>These challenges underscore the necessity of AI red teaming as a specialized cybersecurity discipline. By focusing on AI systems’ unique vulnerabilities, red teams can identify risks that traditional approaches may overlook, ensuring a more robust defense.</p>\n<p>Given the growing use of AI in business-critical applications, AI red teaming is emerging as an essential cybersecurity strategy. This process requires continuous adaptation to evolving threats. Integrating AI red teaming into an organization’s security framework reduces catastrophic model failures, builds stakeholder confidence in AI initiatives, and keeps organizations ahead of adversaries.</p>\n<h3>Best Practices To Get Started With AI Red Teaming</h3>\n<p>To integrate AI red teaming into an enterprise security strategy, consider these best practices for building a robust and proactive approach to safeguarding AI systems.</p>\n<h4>Assemble a Multidisciplinary Team</h4>\n<p>An effective AI red team requires AI experts to address model architecture and vulnerabilities, cybersecurity professionals to tackle adversarial tactics, and data scientists to analyze risks like poisoning or unauthorized manipulation. This combination ensures a comprehensive approach to securing the AI lifecycle.</p>\n<h4>Identify and Prioritize Critical AI Assets for Testing</h4>\n<p>Focus on assets that handle sensitive data, perform critical functions, or are publicly accessible. Catalog models, data pipelines, and APIs, prioritizing systems like fraud detection or customer authentication where vulnerabilities could have significant consequences.</p>\n<h4>Collaborate With Blue Teams</h4>\n<p>Red and blue teams must work together to strengthen defenses. While red teams simulate attacks to uncover vulnerabilities, blue teams focus on detection, response, and mitigation. Sharing findings from red teaming helps improve blue team capabilities and align strategies against real-world threats.</p>\n<h4>Use Specialized Tooling</h4>\n<p>Equip your red team with tools tailored to AI environments, including frameworks for adversarial inputs, reverse engineering model embeddings, or simulating API attacks. These tools help target AI systems more effectively and uncover weaknesses that traditional security testing might miss.</p>\n<h4>Implement Automated Testing</h4>\n<p>For organizations managing large-scale AI deployments, automated red teaming tools streamline vulnerability detection across multiple models and pipelines, enabling comprehensive coverage without overburdening teams.</p>\n<h4>Ensure Compliance With Privacy Guidelines</h4>\n<p>Establish protocols to ensure red teaming activities meet privacy and regulatory standards. This includes anonymizing sensitive data in testing environments to safeguard personal and proprietary information. Proper compliance not only protects your organization legally but also ensures ethical testing practices.</p>\n<h3>Making Red Teaming Part of AI Strategy</h3>\n<p>By adopting a proactive approach to AI security with red teaming, businesses can uncover hidden vulnerabilities, reduce risks, and build resilient systems. Compared to static applications, the dynamic nature of AI systems makes offensive testing even more important for safeguarding operations, maintaining stakeholder trust, and driving innovation with confidence.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Nearly half the traffic on the internet is generated by automated entities called bots, and a large portion of them pose threats to consumers and businesses on the web.</p>\n<p>“[B]ots can help in creating phishing scams by gaining user’s trust and exploiting it for scammers. These scams can have serious implications for the victim, some of which include financial loss, identity theft, and the spread of malware,” Christoph C. Cemper, founder of <a href=\"https://www.aiprm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AIPRM</a>, an AI prompt engineering and management company, in Wilmington, Del., said in a statement provided to TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, this is not the only security threat posed by bots,” he continued. “They can also damage brand reputations, especially for brands and businesses with popular social media profiles and high engagement rates. By associating a brand with fraudulent and unethical practices, bots can tarnish a brand’s reputation and reduce consumer loyalty.”</p>\n<p>According to the Imperva 2024 Bad Bot Report, bad bot traffic levels have risen for the fifth consecutive year, indicating an alarming trend. It noted the increase is partly driven by the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and large learning models (LLMs).</p>\n<p>In 2023, bad bots accounted for 32% of all internet traffic — a 1.8% increase from 2022, the report explained. The portion of good bot traffic also increased, albeit slightly less significantly, from 17.3% of all internet traffic in 2022 to 17.6% in 2023. Combined, 49.6% of all internet traffic in 2023 wasn’t human, as human traffic levels decreased to 50.4% of all traffic.</p>\n<p>“Good bots help index the web for search engines, automate cybersecurity monitoring, and assist customer service through chatbots,” explained James McQuiggan, a security awareness advocate at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla.</p>\n<p>“They assist with detecting vulnerabilities, improving IT workflows, and streamlining procedures online,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The trick is knowing what’s valuable automation and what’s nefarious activity.”</p>\n<h3>Ticket Scalping at Scale</h3>\n<p>Automation and success are driving the growth trends for botnet traffic, explained Thomas Richards, network and red team practice director at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>, an applications security company in Burlington, Mass.</p>\n<p>“Being able to scale up allows malicious actors to achieve their goals,” he told TechNewsWorld. “AI is having an impact by allowing these malicious actors to act more human and automate coding and other tasks. Google, for example, has revealed that Gemini has been used to create malicious things.”</p>\n<p>“We see this in other everyday experiences as well,” he continued, “like the struggle in recent years to get concert tickets to popular events. Scalpers find ways to create users or use compromised accounts to buy tickets faster than a human ever could. They make money by reselling the tickets at a much higher price.”</p>\n<p>It’s easy and profitable to deploy automated attacks, added Stephen Kowski, field CTO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a computer and network security company in Pleasanton, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Criminals are using sophisticated tools to bypass traditional security measures,” he told TechNewsWorld. “AI-powered systems make bots more convincing and harder to detect, enabling them to mimic human behavior better and adapt to defensive measures.”</p>\n<p>“The combination of readily available AI tools and the increasing value of stolen data creates perfect conditions for even more advanced bot attacks in the future,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Why Bad Bots Are a Serious Threat</h3>\n<p>David Brauchler, technical director and head of AI and ML security at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/\">NCC Group</a>, a global cybersecurity consultancy, expects non-human internet traffic to continue to grow.</p>\n<p>“As more devices become internet-connected, SaaS platforms add interconnected functionality, and new vulnerable devices enter the scene, bot-related traffic has had the opportunity to continue increasing its share of network bandwidth,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Brauchler added that bad bots are capable of causing great harm. “Bots have been used to trigger mass outages by overwhelming network resources to deny access to systems and services,” he said.</p>\n<p>“With the advent of generative AI, bots can also be used to impersonate realistic user activity on online platforms, increasing spam risk and fraud,” he explained. “They can also scan for and exploit security vulnerabilities in computer systems.”</p>\n<p>He contended that the biggest risk from AI is the proliferation of spam. “There’s no strong technical solution to identifying and blocking this type of content online,” he explained. “Users have taken to calling this phenomenon AI slop, and it risks drowning out the signal of legitimate online interactions in the noise of artificial content.”</p>\n<p>He cautioned, however, that the industry should be very careful when it considers the best solution to this problem. “Many potential remedies can create more harm, especially those that risk attacking online privacy,” he said.</p>\n<h3>How to Identify Malicious Bots</h3>\n<p>Brauchler acknowledged that it can be difficult for humans to detect a malicious bot. “The overwhelming majority of bots don’t operate in any fashion that humans can detect,” he said. “They contact internet-exposed systems directly, querying for data or interacting with services.”</p>\n<p>“The category of bot that most humans are concerned with are autonomous AI agents that can masquerade as humans in an attempt to defraud people online,” he continued. “Many AI chatbots use predictable speech patterns that users can learn to recognize by interacting with AI text generators online.”</p>\n<p>“Similarly, AI-generated imagery has a number of ‘tells’ that users can learn to look for, including broken patterns, such as hands and clocks being misaligned, edges of objects melting into other objects, and muddled backgrounds,” he said.</p>\n<p>“AI voices also have unusual inflections and expressions of tone that users can learn to pick up on,” he added.</p>\n<p>Malicious bots are often used on social media platforms to gain trusted access to individuals or groups. “Watch for telltale signs like unusual patterns in friend requests, generic or stolen profile pictures, and accounts that post at inhuman speeds or frequencies,” Kowski cautioned.</p>\n<p>He also advised to be wary of profiles with limited personal information, suspicious engagement patterns, or pushing specific agendas through automated responses.</p>\n<p>In the enterprise, he continued, real-time behavioral analysis can spot automated actions that don’t match natural human patterns, such as impossibly fast clicks or form fills.</p>\n<h3>Threat to Businesses</h3>\n<p>Malicious bots can be a significant threat to enterprises, noted Ken Dunham, director of the threat research unit at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.qualys.com\">Qualys</a>, a provider of cloud-based IT, security, and compliance solutions in Foster City, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Once amassed by a threat actor, they can be weaponized,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Bots have incredible resources and capabilities to perform anonymous, distributed, asynchronous attacks against targets of choice, such as brute force credential attacks, distributed denial of service attacks, vulnerability scans, attempted exploitation, and more.”</p>\n<p>Malicious bots can also target login portals, API endpoints, and public-facing systems, which creates risks for organizations as the bad actors probe for weaknesses to find a way to gain access to the internal infrastructure and data, added McQuiggan.</p>\n<p>“Without bot mitigation strategies, companies can be vulnerable to automated threats,” he said.</p>\n<p>To mitigate threats from bad bots, he recommended deploying multi-factor authentication, technological bot detection solutions, and monitoring traffic for anomalies.</p>\n<p>He also recommended blocking old user agents, utilizing Captchas, and limiting interactions, where possible, to reduce success rates.</p>\n<p>“Through security awareness education and human risk management, an employee’s knowledge of bot-driven phishing and fraud attempts can ensure a healthy security culture and reduce the risk of a successful bot attack,” he advised.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The Chinese AI app DeepSeek has created a splash in the artificial intelligence world not seen since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT. All the attention garnered by the AI model, however, could pose a threat to its success in the United States, as other technology companies based in countries Uncle Sam considers “adversary states” have discovered.</p>\n<p>Although the app is barely out of the starting gate, questions have been raised about it as a threat to national security. Those are the kinds of questions that have sunk U.S. sales of companies like Kaspersky and Huawei and threaten the popular social media app TikTok.</p>\n<p>“[T]he U.S. cannot allow CCP [Chinese Communist Party] models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions. We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek’s AI infrastructure,” Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the Select Committee on China, told NBC News Monday.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek exploded on the scene over the weekend when it became the top download at Apple’s App Store in the United States, vaulting AI stalwart ChatGPT. The Chinese app has also been garnering kudos for its speed, efficiency, and mighty reasoning skills.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it runs on less powerful chips than its U.S. competitors. According to DeepSeek, those chips allow it to train its model for less than US$6 million — a fraction of what Google, OpenAI, and Meta are spending to train their models with top-of-the-line processors.</p>\n<p>If DeepSeek’s claims about its technology pass scrutiny, it could dramatically impact the AI industry. There could be less demand for high-octane chipsets, power requirements could be curtailed, and there would be less need for more large-scale data centers, such as those to be built by the Trump administration’s $500 billion Stargate project.</p>\n<p>“DeepSeek does force a question about the costs and investments needed to race to AGI outcomes and innovations,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeff Le</a>, a former California deputy cabinet secretary.</p>\n<p>“This race is also focused on time but there are energy and infrastructure consequences, especially if there is validation that would force others to relook the recently-announced Stargate project,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>National Security Risks</h3>\n<p>Then there’s that national security thing that has tripped up companies like Huawei, Kaspersky, and, most recently, TikTok.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Huawei was a high-flying smartphone and telecommunications maker. It temporarily pushed Apple to third place in the global smartphone market. However, Huawei smartphones were banned from being sold in the United States due to national security concerns, and its market share never recovered.</p>\n<p>In 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security prohibited Kaspersky Lab from directly or indirectly providing antivirus software and cybersecurity products or services in the United States or to U.S. persons.</p>\n<p>The bureau found that the company’s continued operations in the United States presented a national security risk — due to the Russian government’s offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations.</p>\n<p>Then there’s TikTok, which Washington wants out of Chinese hands for fear its owner, ByteDance, could potentially collect and share sensitive data from American users with the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek could pose a greater threat to national security than TikTok, maintained Allie Mellen, a senior analyst with Forrester, a national market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Mass. She pointed out that DeepSeek’s privacy policy explicitly states it can collect “your text or audio input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content” and use it for training purposes.</p>\n<p>“It also states it can share this information with law enforcement agencies, public authorities, and so forth at its discretion, and that any information collected is stored in China,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“In addition,” she continued, “the information being submitted into DeepSeek is more wide-ranging. Some are submitting voice recordings, pictures, personal information, and enterprise data and IP into the tool.”</p>\n<h3>Portal for Data Leakage</h3>\n<p>Rich Vibert, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.metomic.io\">Metomic</a>, a data privacy and security software company in London, asserted that the likelihood of the U.S. government banning DeepSeek hinges on whether its capabilities are perceived as a national security threat.</p>\n<p>“If the tool demonstrates a potential for large-scale exploitation of vulnerabilities or potential to leak sensitive data, it’s plausible that regulatory or security agencies might act to restrict its use,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Such vulnerabilities were reported Monday by <a href=\"https://www.kelacyber.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kela</a>, an Israeli threat intelligence company. “Kela’s AI Red Team was able to jailbreak the [DeepSeek] model across a wide range of scenarios, enabling it to generate malicious outputs, such as ransomware development, fabrication of sensitive content, and detailed instructions for creating toxins and explosive devices,” the company reported in a blog.</p>\n<p>“As AI technologies like DeepSeek become increasingly advanced, the risks of failing to secure sensitive data grow exponentially,” Vibert said.</p>\n<p>He noted that while both DeepSeek and TikTok raise concerns about data security, their risks are distinct. “Concerns around TikTok focus on the scale of data collection, with fears around where and how that data is stored,” he explained. “DeepSeek, however, represents a more targeted risk, as it appears to be designed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities on a massive scale.”</p>\n<p>DeepSeek extends national security concerns beyond the consumer privacy issues of TikTok, contended Gal Ringel, co-founder and CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mineos.ai\">MineOS</a>, a data governance platform based in Tel Aviv, Israel. “It expands to the potential exposure of proprietary business information, trade secrets, and strategic corporate information,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Just as TikTok raised red flags about personal data exposure, DeepSeek’s AI tools apply the same rules of risk to sensitive corporate information,” he said. “Organizations must now urgently audit and track their AI assets to prevent potential data exposure to China.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t just about knowing what AI tools are being used,” Ringel continued. “It’s about understanding where company data flows and ensuring robust safeguards are in place so it doesn’t inadvertently end up in the wrong hands.”</p>\n<p>“The parallels to TikTok are striking, but the stakes may be even higher when considering the potential exposure of business data ending up in adversarial hands,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Protectionist Camouflage</h3>\n<p>National security concerns could also be used to camouflage protectionist policies, the way Apple was protected from Huawei and today’s social media outfits are being protected from TikTok.</p>\n<p>“Trump is totally unpredictable, so we don’t know what’s going to happen in terms of a ban,” said Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a market research firm in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s somewhat premature to speculate, but DeepSeek’s storage of U.S. data on Chinese servers with full access by the Chinese government makes it at least the security risk that TikTok is,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The same logic being applied here would theoretically apply to any Chinese app,” he added. “So, the government must decide what the general policy is. The EU won’t let EU citizen’s data go to U.S. servers. The U.S. could take a similar position with Chinese apps and completely ban those that pose the most significant risks.”</p>\n",

However, Skynet is an AGI (artificial general intelligence), and we aren’t there yet, but Stargate will undoubtedly evolve into AGI. OpenAI, which is at the heart of this effort, believes we are <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a few years away from AGI</a>.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk, arguably the most powerful tech person involved with the U.S. government, seemingly <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/business/trump-aides-furious-with-elon-musk-for-trashing-500b-ai-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn’t believe</a> Stargate can be built. Right now, he appears to be <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/01/23/microsofts-satya-nadella-swipes-at-stargate-ai-venture-alongside-musk-despite-openai-backing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right</a>. However, things can always change.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about the good and bad things that could happen should Stargate succeed. We’ll close with my Product of the Week, the Eight Sleep system.</p>\n<h3>Stargate: The Good</h3>\n<p>The U.S. is in a race to create AGI at scale. Whoever gets there first will gain significant advantages in operations, defense, development, and forecasting. Let’s take each in turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Operations:</strong> AGI will be able to perform a vast number of jobs at machine speeds, everything from managing defense operations to better managing the economy and assuring the best resource use for any relevant project.</p>\n<p>These capabilities could significantly reduce waste, boost productivity, and optimize any government function to an extreme degree. If it stood alone, it could assure U.S. technical leadership for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p><strong>Defense:</strong> From being able to see threats like 9/11 and instantly moving against them to being able to pre-position weapons platforms before they were needed to planning out the optimal weapons to be deployed (or mothballed), Stargate would have the ability to optimize the U.S. military both tactically and strategically, making it far more effective with a range that would extend from protecting individuals to protecting global U.S. assets.</p>\n<p>No human-based system should be able to exceed its capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> AIs can already create their own successors, a trend that will accelerate with AGI. Once built, the AGI version of Stargate could evolve at an unprecedented pace and on a massive scale.</p>\n<p>Its capabilities will grow exponentially as the system continuously refines and improves itself, becoming increasingly effective and difficult to predict. This rapid evolution could drive technological advancements that might otherwise take decades or even centuries to achieve.</p>\n<p>These breakthroughs could span fields such as medical research and space exploration, ushering in an era of transformative, unprecedented change.</p>\n<p><strong>Forecasting:</strong> In the movie “Minority Report,” there was the concept of being able to stop crimes before they were committed using precognition.</p>\n<p>An AGI at the scale of Stargate and with access to the sensors from Nvidia’s Earth 2 project could more accurately forecast coming weather events further into the future than we can today.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>However, given how much data Stargate would have access to, it should be able to predict a growing group of events long before a human sees the potential for that event to occur.</p>\n<p>Everything from potential catastrophic failures in nuclear plants to potential equipment failures in military or commercial planes, anything this technology touched would at once be more reliable and far less likely to fail catastrophically because Stargate’s AI would be, with the proper sensor feeds, be able to see the future and better prepare for both positive and negative outcomes.</p>\n<p>In short, an AGI at Stargate’s scale would be God-like in its reach and capabilities, with the potential to make the world a better, safer place to live.</p>\n<h3>Stargate: The Bad</h3>\n<p>We are planning on giving birth to a massive intelligence based on information it learns from us. We aren’t exactly a perfect model for how another intelligence should behave.</p>\n<p>Without adequate ethical considerations (and ethics isn’t exactly a global constant), a focus on preserving the quality of life, and a directed effort to assure a positive strategic outcome for people, Stargate could do harm in many ways, including job destruction, acting against humanity’s best interests, hallucinations, intentional harm (to the AGI), and self-preservation (Skynet).</p>\n<p><strong>Job Destruction:</strong> AI can be used to help people become better, but it is mainly used to either increase productivity or replace people.</p>\n<p>If you have a 10-person team and you double their productivity, but the task load stays the same, you only need five employees — AIs are being trained to replace people.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Uber, for instance, is eventually expected to move to driverless cars. From pilots to engineers, AGI will be capable of doing many jobs, and humans will not be able to compete with any fully competent AI because AIs don’t need to sleep or eat, nor do they get sick.</p>\n<p>Without significant and currently unplanned enhancement, people just can’t compete with fully trained AGI.</p>\n<p><strong>Acting Against Humanity’s Best Interest:</strong> This assumes that Stargate AGI is still taking direction from people who tend to be tactical and not strategic.</p>\n<p>For instance, L.A.’s cut of funding for firefighters was a tactically sound move to balance a budget, but strategically, it helped wipe out a lot of homes and lives because it wasn’t strategic.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine decisions like this made at greater scale. Conflicting directives will be increasingly common, and the danger of some kind of HAL (“2001: A Space Odyssey”) is significant. An “oops” here could cause incalculable damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> Generative AI has a hallucination problem. It fabricates data to complete tasks, leading to avoidable failures. AGI will face similar issues but may pose even greater challenges to ensure reliability due to its vastly increased complexity and partial creation by Generative AI.</p>\n<p>The movie “WarGames” depicted an AI unable to distinguish between a game and reality, with control over the U.S. nuclear arsenal. A similar outcome could occur if Stargate were to mistake a simulation for an actual attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Intentional Harm:</strong> Stargate will be a huge potential target for those both inside and outside the U.S. Whether to mine it for confidential information, to alter its directives so that it does harm, or just helps some person, company, or government unfairly, this project will have unprecedented potential for security risks.</p>\n<p>Even if the attack has no intention of doing massive harm, if it is done poorly, it could result in problems ranging from system failure to actions that cause significant loss of life and monetary damage.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Once fully integrated into government operations, it would have the potential to take the U.S. to its knees and create global catastrophes. This means the defense of this project from foreign and domestic attackers will also be unprecedented.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-Preservation:</strong> The idea that an AGI might want to survive is hardly new. It goes to the core of the plots in “The Terminator,” “The Matrix,” and “Robopocalypse.” Even the movie “Colossus: The Forbin Project” was somewhat based on the idea of an AI that wanted to protect itself, though in that case, it was made so secure that people couldn’t take back control of the system.</p>\n<p>The idea that an AI might conclude that humanity is the problem to fix isn’t a huge stretch, and how it went about self-preservation could be incredibly dangerous to us, as those movies showcased.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Stargate has massive potential for both good and bad outcomes. Assuring the first outcome while preventing the second would require a level of focus on ethics, security, programming quality, and execution that would exceed anything we’ve ever tried as a race.</p>\n<p>If we get it right (the odds initially are against this since we tend to learn from trial and error), it could help bring about a new age for the U.S. and humanity. If we do it wrong, it could end us. So, the stakes couldn’t be higher, and I doubt we are currently up to the task as we simply do not have a great history of successfully building massively complex projects the first time.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’d put IBM at the head of this effort. It has worked with AI the longest, had ethics designed into the process, and has decades of experience with extremely large, secure projects like this. I think IBM has the highest probability of ensuring better results and fewer bad ones from this effort.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Eight Sleep Water Cooled Mattress Cover</h3>\n<p>I’ve been a user of the Chilipad since the beginning. It has truly improved my sleep performance over the years, but it went through distilled water like crazy, and distilled water isn’t that common.</p>\n<p>So, when my Chilipad Pros started dumping water on the floor, I picked up an <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eight Sleep</a> system that has some critical advantages. First, for a large bed, there is only one tall unit to manage and one thick set of hoses that go to the head of the bed. This allows you to place the Eight Sleep system by the headboard rather than at the foot of the bed, which is more convenient for me.</p>\n<p>It comes with built-in sleep monitoring that requires a subscription (this was optional on the Chilipad). While the Chilipad’s improved mattress topper was far more comfortable than the old one, the Eight Sleep mattress topper is even better. It looks better, too, though, given that the sheets cover it, that doesn’t mean that much. Still, better is better.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Eight-Sleep.jpg\" alt=\"Eight Sleep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Eight-Sleep.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Eight-Sleep-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Eight-Sleep-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Eight Sleep</p>\n<p>The sleep monitor is AI-based, and so far (I’ve had mine for several months now), it has worked incredibly well after its learning period, which is when it figures out the best temperatures for you. The bed is generally the perfect temperature at all times of the night.</p>\n<p>Finally — and this was huge for me — it doesn’t use much water. In the months I’ve had this, I’ve used something like an eighth of a cup of water and have yet to need to refill it (my guess is I’ll have to do this twice a year), which is a <em>huge</em> improvement over the Chilipad, which went through nearly a gallon of water a week, sometimes more.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we have tile floors, so I don’t have floor damage, but if I had carpet, I’d have likely had to replace it and check to make sure I didn’t have mold or structural wood damage from the water. This alone would cause me to select the Eight Sleep system over the Chilipad.</p>\n<p>Also, they have an option that the Chilipad does not have and that I haven’t yet bought: a pad that goes under the mattress and elevates the bed, which is great for stopping snoring or watching TV.</p>\n<p>So, because the Eight Sleep system is better than the Chilipad and because it’s helped me with my sleep issues (getting old sucks), it is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Fact-checkers are headed to the dustbin of history at Meta.</p>\n<p>“We will end the current third-party fact-checking program in the United States and instead begin moving to a Community Notes program,” Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan announced in a company blog on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Kaplan added that Meta would also be addressing the “mission creep” that has made the rules governing the company’s platforms too restrictive and prone to over-enforcement.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate,” he wrote. “It’s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Meta will be modifying the automated systems that scan its platforms for policy violations. “[T]his has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn’t have been,” Kaplan wrote.</p>\n<p>Going forward, the systems will focus on illegal and high-severity violations, like terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud, and scams, while less severe policy violations will depend on someone reporting an issue before any action is taken.</p>\n<p>Meta is also making it harder to remove content from the platforms by requiring multiple reviewers to reach a determination in order to take something down and allowing users to see more civic content — posts about elections, politics, or social issues — should they desire it.</p>\n<h3>Censorship Tool</h3>\n<p>Kaplan explained that when Meta launched its independent fact-checking program in 2016, it didn’t want to be the arbiter of truth, so it handed the responsibility of fact-checking content to independent organizations.</p>\n<p>“The intention of the program was to have these independent experts give people more information about the things they see online, particularly viral hoaxes, so they were able to judge for themselves what they saw and read,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>“That’s not the way things played out, especially in the United States,” he continued. “Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how.”</p>\n<p>“Over time, we ended up with too much content being fact-checked that people would understand to be legitimate political speech and debate,” he noted. “Our system then attached real consequences in the form of intrusive labels and reduced distribution. A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank, served on a Facebook content policy team and said he was bothered by the selection bias of the group. “The only people who joined to be fact-checkers wanted to moderate content,” he told TechNewsWorld. “People who wanted users to make their own decisions about content didn’t become fact-checkers.”</p>\n<p>“My experience with the effectiveness of Facebook’s fact-checking was pretty mixed overall,” added Darian Shimy, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://www.futurefund.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FutureFund</a>, a fundraising platform for K-12 schools and PTAs, in Pleasanton, Calif.</p>\n<p>“It’s safe to say that it added a layer of accountability, but candidly, I found it was too slow and inconsistent to keep up with the pace of viral misinformation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Talking to many people in my circle and researching internally, I found that most people felt that relying on third-party fact-checkers created a perception of bias, which didn’t always help build trust with users.”</p>\n<h3>‘Not a Victory for Free Speech’</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics/about-the-center/people/irina-raicu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Irina Raicu</a>, director for internet ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, noted that there was plenty of disinformation showing up on Facebook under the existing fact-checking regime.</p>\n<p>“Part of the problem was the automation of content moderation,” she told TechNewsWorld. “The algorithmic tools were pretty blunt and missed the nuances of both language and images. And the problem was even more widespread in posts in languages other than English.”</p>\n<p>“With billions of pieces of content posted daily, it was simply impossible for human fact-checkers to keep up,” added Paul Benigeri, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://archive.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Archive</a>, a company that develops software to automate e-commerce digital marketing workflows, in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Fact-checking felt more like a PR move,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Sometimes it worked, but it never came close to catching the full volume of misleading posts.”</p>\n<p>Meta scrapping its fact-checking system was questioned by Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor, founder and executive director of <a href=\"https://cyberwell.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CyberWell</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting antisemitism on social media, headquartered in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“While the previous fact-checking system has proven to be an ineffective and unscalable method of combatting misinformation and disinformation during real-time conflicts and emergencies,” she told TechNewsWorld, “the answer cannot be less accountability and less investment from the side of the platforms.”</p>\n<p>“This is not a victory for free speech,” she declared. “It’s an exchange of human bias in a small and contained group of fact-checkers for human bias at scale through Community Notes. The only way to prevent censorship and data manipulation by any government or corporation would be to institute legal requirements and reforms on big tech that enforce social media reform and transparency requirements.”</p>\n<h3>Flawed Community Solution</h3>\n<p>Meta’s Community Notes replacement for fact-checking is modeled on a similar scheme deployed on X, formerly Twitter. “The community-based approach is nice in that it deals partially with the scale issue,” said <a href=\"https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/cody-buntain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cody Buntain</a>, an assistant professor at the College of Information at the University of Maryland. “It allows many more people to engage with this process and add context.”</p>\n<p>“The problem is that community notes, while it can work in the large aggregate scale for occasional pieces of information or the occasional story that goes viral, it is generally not fast enough and gets totally overwhelmed with new major events,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“We saw this in the aftermath of the attacks in Israel back in October of 2023,” he continued. “There were people highly engaged in the community note process, but Twitter as a platform just got swamped and overwhelmed with the amount of misinformation going on around this event.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>“When the platforms say, ‘We’re going to wash our hands of this and let the community deal with it,’ that becomes problematic in these moments where the only people who really can deal with massive influxes of high-velocity, low-quality information are the platforms,” he said. “Community notes aren’t really set up to deal with those issues, and those are the moments when you want high-quality information the most.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never been a fan of community notes,” added Karen Kovacs North, clinical professor of communication at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://annenberg.usc.edu/\">Annenberg</a> School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>“The type of people who are willing to put notes on something are usually polarized and passionate,” she told TechNewsWorld. “The middle-of-the-roaders don’t take time to put their comments down on a story or a piece of content.”</p>\n<h3>Currying Trump’s Favor</h3>\n<p><a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://emerson.edu/faculty-staff-directory/vincent-raynauld\">Vincent Raynauld</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Emerson College, noted that while community moderation sounds great in theory, it has some problems. “Even though the content might be flagged as being disinformation or misleading, the content is still available to people to consume,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“So even though some people might see the community note, they might still consume that content, and that content might still have an impact on their attitudes, knowledge, and behavior,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Along with the Kaplan announcement, Meta released a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> of CEO Mark Zuckerberg hailing the company’s latest moves. “We’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Zuckerberg’s announcement has nothing to do with making Meta’s platforms better and everything to do with currying favor with Donald Trump,” asserted <a href=\"https://camd.northeastern.edu/people/dan-kennedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Kennedy</a>, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University, in Boston.</p>\n<p>“There was a time when Zuckerberg cared about his products being used to promote dangerous misinformation and disinformation, about the January 6 insurrection and Covid,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Now Trump is returning to office, and one of Zuckerberg’s rivals, Elon Musk, is running amok with Trump’s indulgence, so Zuckerberg is just getting with the program.”</p>\n<p>“No system of fact-checking and moderation is perfect,” he added, “but if Zuckerberg really cared, he’d work to improve it rather than getting rid of it altogether.”</p>\n<h3>Musk as Trend Setter</h3>\n<p>Damian Rollison, director of marketing for <a href=\"https://www.soci.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SOCi</a>, a comarketing cloud platform headquartered in San Diego, pointed out an irony in Meta’s latest move. “I think it’s safe to say that no one predicted Elon Musk’s chaotic takeover of Twitter would become a trend other tech platforms would follow, and yet here we are,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“We can see now, in retrospect, that Musk established a standard for a newly conservative approach to the loosening of online content moderation, one that Meta has now embraced in advance of the incoming Trump administration,” he said.</p>\n<p>“What this will likely mean is that Facebook and Instagram will see a spike in political speech and posts on controversial topics,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“As with Musk’s X, where ad revenues are down by half, this change may make the platform less attractive to advertisers,” he added. “It may also cement a trend whereby Facebook is becoming the social network for older, more conservative users and ceding Gen Z to TikTok, with Instagram occupying a middle ground between them.”</p>\n",

IBM will consider future pricing and packaging decisions pending market feedback.</p>\n<h3>Market Trends Show New Uses for Climate Data</h3>\n<p>IBM is targeting a specific audience of technical builders, developers, and data scientist communities because of observed trends in the market. According to Blanch, these targeted users are not necessarily all climate scientists or meteorologists who benefit from accessing the innovative data, putting it behind an API, and applying embeddable use cases across their existing applications.</p>\n<p>The trends involve how climate change is impacting business operations across various verticals. Research indicates that climate-related disasters are causing significant losses on a macro level. Some of the datasets within environmental intelligence fall into a couple of buckets.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>One dataset is open-source satellite imagery, offering high-resolution visuals captured by European satellites orbiting the globe every five days. This imagery supports a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring to regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>“An organization could access that raw imagery on its own but would encounter a lot of challenge with pre-processing cloud removals,” noted Blanch in a key benefit of using the EI platform instead.</p>\n<p>Another dataset includes meteorological data such as historical records, real-time updates, and short-term weather forecasts. Blanch noted that climate projections for more long-term needs involving climate planning should be added to those scenarios.</p>\n<p>Thinking in terms of specific business examples, how do you build more resiliency inside your organization regarding natural hazards like floods and wildfires? How do you handle disaster risk planning and risk assessments? How do you calculate your business’s carbon emissions?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-complex-data-querying.jpg\" alt=\"A wildfire hazard map of the United States displaying high-risk areas with red and yellow heatmap overlays to support disaster planning and resiliency efforts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-complex-data-querying.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-complex-data-querying-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-complex-data-querying-768x455.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Visualizing wildfire risk across regions using IBM’s Environmental Intelligence platform for disaster planning and resiliency.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“If you think about how companies are operationalizing sustainability, they have an industrial asset and a methane link to a carbon equivalent in today’s workflow. A work order might be issued so that somebody can go perform some maintenance for these different operational groups who are not traditional sustainability-minded people,” Blanch suggested.</p>\n<h3>Sustainability Solutions for Diverse Industries</h3>\n<p>According to Blanch, IBM wants to expand beyond traditional uses to benefit the potential applications in other industries. He referenced use cases already showing EI success in agriculture, such as crop monitoring, yield prediction, and precision farming.</p>\n<p>For example, easier access to satellite data is helping organizations comply with new environmental regulations from governments. The European Union’s deforestation regulation is a case in point.</p>\n<p>It requires companies to review their supply chains and verify they are not working with suppliers who violate these regulatory requirements involving extensive land use changes.</p>\n<p>Another example involves how IBM’s EI technology can impact animal growth and influence nutrition adjustments based on environmental conditions. Some groups developed a predictive modeling system using weather data to assess mycotoxin levels in their crops. They were able to create a forecasting model using environmental and weather data from the platform to improve their business operations.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-PRISM-temperature-map.jpg\" alt=\"A temperature distribution map of the United States with color gradients from blue to red, aiding climate modeling for agriculture and environmental decision-making.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-PRISM-temperature-map.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-PRISM-temperature-map-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/EI-PRISM-temperature-map-768x479.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Temperature distribution map aiding predictive modeling for agriculture and climate-related decision-making.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“The potential for third-party, remote imaging is tremendous. So you don’t need to be meteorologists or climate experts, but you can have access to a pre-processed, curated data set that could be available with easy tutorials, samples, and guides to embed those within your applications, models, or workflows,” Blanch said about the goal of IBM’s EI software.</p>\n<p><em>The OpenStreetMap images in this article were provided to TechNewsWorld courtesy of IBM.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>As a longtime user of the original Sonos Arc, I approached the new <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/arc-ultra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonos Arc Ultra</a> with excitement <em>and</em> skepticism.</p>\n<p>The original Arc has been a staple in my home entertainment setup. It delivers impressive Dolby Atmos sound and effortlessly integrates with the Sonos ecosystem.</p>\n<p>With the Arc Ultra promising upgrades in sound quality, design, and connectivity, I was eager to see if it could live up to the hype and justify its higher price tag.</p>\n<p>After spending time with the Ultra, it’s clear that Sonos hasn’t just refined its flagship soundbar; they’ve reimagined what a standalone audio system can offer. But is it enough to tempt existing Arc users like me to take the leap? Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p>The Sonos Arc Ultra, released on Oct. 29, is Sonos’ latest flagship soundbar. It is priced at $999 and available in black or white.</p>\n<p>This new release marks a slight price increase over its predecessor, the original Arc, which is discontinued and now being sold at discounted rates as retailers clear remaining stock.</p>\n<p>The Arc Ultra enters a competitive market, facing rivals like the Sony Bravia Theatre Bar 9 and the Samsung HW-Q990D. Both offer compelling features and, at times, significant discounts.</p>\n<h3>Design and Build</h3>\n<p>Visually, the Arc Ultra closely resembles the original Arc, maintaining Sonos’ minimalist aesthetic with a perforated grille encompassing most of the chassis. However, subtle changes include a ledge at the back housing touch controls — play/pause, skip, volume slider, and a voice control button — relocated from the main grille.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-controls.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos Arc Ultra touch controls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-controls.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-controls-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-controls-768x383.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The soundbar’s dimensions have been adjusted ever so slightly: it’s wider at 118cm (up from 114cm) but shorter in height at 7.5cm (down from 8.7cm), reducing the likelihood of obstructing the TV screen when placed in front. Weighing approximately 350g less than its predecessor, the Arc Ultra is also more wall-mount friendly.</p>\n<p>The design requires an open placement, as positioning it in a nook or under a shelf can impede the upward-firing drivers essential for optimal sound dispersion.</p>\n<h3>Features and Connectivity</h3>\n<p>The Arc Ultra boasts a 9.1.4-channel configuration, a significant upgrade from the original Arc’s 5.0.2 setup. It incorporates 14 custom-engineered drivers powered by 15 Class D amplifiers, including seven tweeters, six midrange woofers, and a novel Sound Motion woofer.</p>\n<p>This innovative woofer utilizes four smaller, lightweight motors to move the cone, enabling greater air displacement and, according to Sonos, delivering up to twice the bass of the original Arc. The dual-cone design also aims to minimize mechanical vibrations, contributing to a more balanced sound profile.</p>\n<p>Despite these advancements, the Arc Ultra lacks support for DTS audio formats, focusing solely on Dolby Atmos for spatial audio. Connectivity options remain limited, with a single HDMI eARC port and no dedicated HDMI inputs, necessitating all external sources being connected through the TV. This setup may pose challenges for users with multiple high-spec gaming devices and limited HDMI 2.1 ports on their TVs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-front-and-back.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos Arc Ultra home theatre soundbar front and back views\" width=\"1000\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-front-and-back.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-front-and-back-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Sonos-Arc-Ultra-front-and-back-768x442.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Sonos Arc Ultra home theater soundbar: front view (pictured top) and back view</p>\n<p>On the upside, the Arc Ultra introduces Bluetooth connectivity (a first for Sonos soundbars) and expands Sonos’ excellent Trueplay calibration support to Android devices, enhancing user accessibility.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>In terms of audio performance, the Arc Ultra delivers a clean, precise, and spacious soundstage with impressive three-dimensionality. The enhanced bass is deep and expressive, providing a solid foundation without overwhelming the overall sound profile.</p>\n<p>Dialogue clarity has improved, thanks to the new front-firing speaker array dedicated to the center channel, ensuring crisp and intelligible speech reproduction. The soundbar excels in detail retrieval, capturing subtle nuances across various content types.</p>\n<p>However, the absence of HDMI passthrough and DTS support may be limiting for some users. Additionally, while the Sonos app offers robust control and customization options, some users have reported occasional issues that could affect the overall user experience.</p>\n<h3>How Arc Ultra Stacks Up Against Rivals</h3>\n<p>Compared to competitors like the Sony Bravia Theatre Bar 9 and the Samsung HW-Q990D, the Arc Ultra holds its ground in terms of sound quality and design.</p>\n<p>Though officially priced higher, the Sony Bravia Theatre Bar 9 often sees discounts that bring it closer to the Arc Ultra’s price point. The Bravia Theatre Bar 9 boasts a comprehensive feature set, including HDMI passthrough and support for both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X formats, offering greater flexibility for users with diverse content sources.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>While more expensive, the Samsung HW-Q990D includes a wireless subwoofer and surround speakers, delivering a more immersive surround sound experience out of the box. Its connectivity options are more extensive, featuring multiple HDMI inputs and support for various audio formats, making it a versatile choice for users seeking a comprehensive home theater setup.</p>\n<h3>Is Arc Ultra Worth the Upgrade?</h3>\n<p>To be sure, Sonos has long faced criticism for its app, which, while offering a sleek design and robust control options, has been plagued by occasional connectivity issues and limited flexibility.</p>\n<p>Users often report frustrations with delayed updates, difficulty adding new devices, and problems syncing across the ecosystem. These woes are especially frustrating given the premium price of Sonos products, which sets high expectations for seamless integration.</p>\n<p>Although recent updates have aimed to address some of these issues, the app experience still leaves room for improvement, particularly as competitors continue to refine their platforms. While I have suffered through some of these issues myself (particularly with Sonos’ terrific over-the-ears Ace headphones), the app has thankfully matured to the point that it didn’t inhibit setup.</p>\n<p>Still, from a pure hardware standpoint, the Sonos Arc Ultra represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, offering enhanced bass performance, improved dialogue clarity, and a more immersive soundstage.</p>\n<p>Its sleek design and expanded connectivity options, including Bluetooth and broader Trueplay support, make it a compelling choice for users seeking a high-quality, all-in-one soundbar solution. However, the lack of HDMI passthrough and DTS support may be a consideration for potential buyers.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Arc Ultra is a superb soundbar that elevates the home audio experience, making it a worthy contender in the premium soundbar market.</p>\n<p><em>The Arc Ultra images featured in this article are credited to Sonos.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>An emphasis on fiber optic broadband delivery blunts the effectiveness and reach of a federal program created to close the gap between internet haves and have-nots, according to a report released Tuesday by the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itif.org/\">Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation</a> (ITIF).</p>\n<p>The Washington, D.C. tech think tank maintained that the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program is financially imperiled by a preference for deployment projects using fiber-optic cables.</p>\n<p>It called on the Trump administration to reform BEAD to stop favoring overly expensive fiber when low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites could do the same job for less.</p>\n<p>Taking a technology-neutral approach to broadband deployment would save money that could be better spent on other causes of the digital divide, it argued in its 11-page report.</p>\n<p>“We think tech neutrality would have made sense from the beginning, but certainly in the years since the law was initially adopted, a lot of satellites have been launched, and there have been a lot of fixed wireless deployments,” said ITIF Director of Spectrum and Broadband Policy Joe Kane.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really need to be putting fiber everywhere if there are viable satellite and fixed wireless options,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Tech Overruns Guidance</h3>\n<p>The legislation creating BEAD was passed three years ago and funded to the tune of US$42.45 billion. The program aimed to help communities overcome the barrier of high front-end broadband deployment costs and get high-speed internet service to every American who wanted it.</p>\n<p>“[I]t has become clear that technological advancements have outrun the program’s regulatory guidelines,” Kane and Research Assistant Ellis Scherer wrote in the report. “The main issue is that BEAD is not technology neutral,” they continued. “The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has designed the program to give it a strong preference for using expensive fiber-optic cables. The result is that the money funds more expensive infrastructure than is needed, which will ultimately limit BEAD’s impact in bridging the digital divide.”</p>\n<p>The NTIA declined to comment for this story.</p>\n<p>According to the report, states could save tens of millions of dollars on their deployment efforts if BEAD could better incorporate cheaper yet still high-performing technologies such as fixed wireless broadband, such as 5G internet, and satellite service. Those savings could then be used to address the other principal causes of the digital divide, including affordability for low-income households and digital literacy, it added.</p>\n<p>“The change in administrations can be a good inflection point to take stock of where we are now,” Kane said. “The satellite ecosystem is a lot different than it was when President Biden took office. The same can be said for the fixed wireless ecosystem.”</p>\n<h3>Underfunded From the Start</h3>\n<p>Jim Dunstan, general counsel for <a href=\"https://techfreedom.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechFreedom</a>, a technology advocacy group in Washington, D.C., maintained that BEAD has been underfunded since its inception. “$42.5 billion isn’t going to get broadband to everybody no matter what technology you use,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He added that inflation has increased dramatically since the passage of the BEAD legislation. “That makes closing the digital divide with $42.5 billion even less likely,” he said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, he acknowledged, “I think the NTIA really missed the ball on this by giving a nod to fiber.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>While fiber is expensive, it has advantages, besides performance, over satellite technologies, countered <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ry-marcattilio-43488535/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ry Marcattilio</a>, associate director for research at the Community Broadband Networks Initiative of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization and advocacy group that provides technical assistance to communities about local solutions for sustainable community development, with offices in Washington, D.C., Portland, Maine, and Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>“Fiber is certainly more expensive to build, but it solves the problem for a geometrically longer time horizon than LEO satellite services,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Those satellites have to be replaced every five years.”</p>\n<p>“This argument that we should build broadband infrastructure in a ‘technology-neutral way’ I think is a recipe for having to spend thousands of dollars every five years on the same household over and over and over again, instead of running fiber to the vast majority of them and solving the problem once for three or four generations in a row,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Niche Solution?</h3>\n<p>Marcattilio contended that satellite internet is a good niche solution for a small number of very rural households. “It works well as a niche solution if you don’t care about shifting the burden of startup and monthly costs onto households.”</p>\n<p>“LEO service will work well for a small number of households, and this has been true since its inception,” he added. “I think it will be true for a while, but it’s never going to be a mass market solution the way we all might wish it were.”</p>\n<p>“If we handed the $42.5 billion to the satellite providers, you could deliver broadband to 100% of Americans pretty easily,” Dunstan contended. “The problem is, what kind of service can you squeeze out of those satellites?”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>He explained that satellite networks claim they can support 100 Mbps downloads and 20 Mbps uploads. “The problem is when you start adding people to the service,” he said. “You’re sharing bandwidth. At some point, even with 6,000 satellites up there, it’s going to be hard to maintain that speed.”</p>\n<p>Kane conceded congestion could be a problem for satellite networks, but it’s less of a concern for BEAD users. “BEAD is targeting people in rural and remote locations, places where broadband has never been deployed before,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“In those places, there’s not going to be thousands of people signing up at once,” he continued. “We’re talking about areas where there aren’t thousands of people at all.”</p>\n<h3>Fouled in Politics</h3>\n<p>John Strand of Strand Consulting, an advisory firm focusing on global telecom based in Denmark, argued that the NTIA should not have been charged with administering the program. “It was political from the start,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The FCC should have had responsibility. It has experience in subsidy distribution and provides bipartisan accountability.”</p>\n<p>He contended that BEAD was supposed to be tech-neutral, but the NTIA put its thumb on the scale in favor of fiber solutions. “This is because fiber builds typically require more labor. Hence, unions get involved, a Democratic Party constituency,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Fiber networks also lend themselves to delivering increasing amounts of video entertainment traffic and advertising from the Big Tech and Hollywood platforms, helpful to another traditional Dem constituency,” he added.</p>\n<p>He also noted that BEAD had climate and DEI requirements, which were not welcome in red states. “The NTIA put requirements on the money which Congress did not require,” he added. “This made the program take longer to administer.”</p>\n<p>“Wireless technologies are, in general, more economical, but no one network type is always the right solution for every situation,” he explained. “Networks are a blend of technologies.”</p>\n<p>“I expect Arielle Roth will be named the head of NTIA and predict she will either kill BEAD or remake it into something practical, not political, or aspirational,” he observed.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Cisco is taking a radical approach to AI security in its new AI Defense solution.</p>\n<p>In an exclusive interview Sunday with Rowan Cheung of <a href=\"https://www.therundown.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Rundown AI</a>, Cisco Executive Vice President and CPO Jeetu Patel said that AI Defense is “taking a radical approach to address the challenges that existing security solutions are not equipped to handle.”</p>\n<p>AI Defense, announced last week, aims to address risks in developing and deploying AI applications, as well as identifying where AI is used in an organization.</p>\n<p>AI Defense can protect AI systems from attacks and safeguard model behavior across platforms with features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detection of shadow and sanctioned AI applications across public and private clouds;</li>\n<li>Automated testing of AI models for hundreds of potential safety and security issues; and</li>\n<li>Continuous validation safeguards against potential safety and security threats, such as prompt injection, denial of service, and sensitive data leakage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The solution also allows security teams to better protect their organizations’ data by providing a comprehensive view of AI apps used by employees, create policies that restrict access to unsanctioned AI tools, and implement safeguards against threats and confidential data loss while ensuring compliance.</p>\n<p>“The adoption of AI exposes companies to new risks that traditional cybersecurity solutions don’t address,” Kent Noyes, global head of AI and cyber innovation at technology services company <a href=\"https://www.wwt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">World Wide Technology</a> in St. Louis, said in a statement. “Cisco AI Defense represents a significant leap forward in AI security, providing full visibility of an enterprise’s AI assets and protection against evolving threats.”</p>\n<h3>Positive Step for AI Security</h3>\n<p>MJ Kaufmann, an author and instructor at <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">O’Reilly Media</a>, operator of a learning platform for technology professionals, in Boston, affirmed Cisco’s analysis of existing cybersecurity solutions. “Cisco is right,” she told TechNewsWorld. “Existing tools fail to address many operationally driven attacks against AI systems, such as prompt injection attacks, data leakage, and unauthorized model action.”</p>\n<p>“Implementers must take action and implement targeted solutions to address them,” she added.</p>\n<p>Cisco is in a unique position to provide this kind of solution, noted Jack E. Gold, founder and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jgoldassociates.com/\">J.Gold Associates</a>, an IT advisory company in Northborough, Mass. “That’s because they have a lot of data from their networking telemetry that can be used to reinforce the AI capabilities they want to protect,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Cisco also wants to provide security across platforms — on-premises, cloud, and multi-cloud — and across models, he added.</p>\n<p>“It’ll be interesting to see how many companies adopt this,” he said. “Cisco is certainly moving in the right direction with this kind of capability because companies, generally speaking, aren’t looking at this very effectively.”</p>\n<p>Providing multi-model, multi-cloud protection is important for AI security.</p>\n<p>“Multi-model, multi-cloud AI solutions expand an organization’s attack surface by introducing complexity across disparate environments with inconsistent security protocols, multiple data transfer points, and challenges in coordinating monitoring and incident response — factors that threat actors can more easily exploit,” Patricia Thaine, CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.private-ai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Private AI</a>, a data security and privacy company in Toronto, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Concerning Limitations</h3>\n<p>Although Cisco’s approach of embedding security controls at the network layer through their existing infrastructure mesh shows promise, it also reveals concerning limitations, maintained Dev Nag, CEO and founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.querypal.com\">QueryPal</a>, a customer support chatbot based in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“While network-level visibility provides valuable telemetry, many AI-specific attacks occur at the application and model layers that network monitoring alone cannot detect,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The acquisition of Robust Intelligence last year gives Cisco important capabilities around model validation and runtime protection, but their focus on network integration may lead to gaps in securing the actual AI development lifecycle,” he said. “Critical areas like training pipeline security, model supply chain verification, and fine-tuning guardrails require deep integration with MLOps tooling that goes beyond Cisco’s traditional network-centric paradigm.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Think about the headaches we’ve seen with open-source supply chain attacks where the offending code is openly visible,” he added. “Model supply chain attacks are almost impossible to detect by comparison.”</p>\n<p>Nag noted that from an implementation perspective, Cisco AI Defense appears to be primarily a repackaging of existing security products with some AI-specific monitoring capabilities layered on top.</p>\n<p>“While their extensive deployment footprint provides advantages for enterprise-wide visibility, the solution feels more reactive than transformative for now,” he maintained. “For some organizations beginning their AI journey that are already working with Cisco security products, Cisco AI Defense may provide useful controls, but those pursuing advanced AI capabilities will likely need more sophisticated security architectures purpose-built for machine learning systems.”</p>\n<p>For many organizations, mitigating AI risks requires human penetration testers who understand how to ask the models questions that elicit sensitive information, added Karen Walsh, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://allegrosolutionsllc.com/\">Allegro Solutions</a>, a cybersecurity consulting company in West Hartford, Conn.</p>\n<p>“Cisco’s release suggests that their ability to create model-specific guardrails will mitigate these risks to keep the AI from learning on bad data, responding to malicious requests, and sharing unintended information,” she told TechNewsWorld. “At the very least, we could hope that this would identify and mitigate baseline issues so that pen testers could focus on more sophisticated AI compromise strategies.”</p>\n<h3>Critical Need in the Path to AGI</h3>\n<p>Kevin Okemwa, writing for <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows Central</a>, notes that the launch of AI Defense couldn’t come at a better time as the major AI labs are closing in on producing true artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is supposed to replicate human intelligence.</p>\n<p>“As AGI gets closer with each passing year, the stakes couldn’t be higher,” said James McQuiggan, a security awareness advocate at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“AGI’s ability to think like a human with intuition and orientation can revolutionize industries, but it also introduces risks that could have far-reaching consequences,” he told TechNewsWorld. “A robust AI security solution ensures that AGI evolves responsibly, minimizing risks like rogue decision-making or unintended consequences.”</p>\n<p>“AI security isn’t just a ‘nice-to-have’ or something to think about in the years to come,” he added. “It’s critical as we move toward AGI.”</p>\n<h3>Existential Doom?</h3>\n<p>Okemwa also wrote: “While AI Defense is a step in the right direction, its adoption across organizations and major AI labs remains to be seen. Interestingly, the OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman] acknowledges the technology’s threat to humanity but believes AI will be smart enough to prevent AI from causing existential doom.”</p>\n<p>“I see some optimism about AI’s ability to self-regulate and prevent catastrophic outcomes, but I also notice in the adoption that aligning advanced AI systems with human values is still an afterthought rather than an imperative,” Adam Ennamli, chief risk and security officer at the General Bank of Canada told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The notion that AI will solve its own existential risks is dangerously optimistic, as demonstrated by current AI systems that can already be manipulated to create harmful content and bypass security controls,” added Stephen Kowski, field CTO at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a computer and network security company, in Pleasanton, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Technical safeguards and human oversight remain essential since AI systems are fundamentally driven by their training data and programmed objectives, not an inherent desire for human well-being,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Human beings are pretty creative,” Gold added. “I don’t buy into this whole doomsday nonsense. We’ll figure out a way to make AI work for us and do it safely. That’s not to say there won’t be issues along the way, but we’re not all going to end up in ‘The Matrix’.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Risk management in many organizations is mired in a framework that can’t keep pace with the challenges that most enterprise risk teams face. It needs to be modernized.</p>\n<p>That’s the verdict that senior analysts Cody Scott and Alla Valente handed down in a recent <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester Research</a> blog that’s critical of the Three Lines of Defense (3LOD) approach, which is widely used to assess organizational risk.</p>\n<p>“Conventional means of managing risk haven’t kept pace with the demand, velocity, or pressure that most enterprise risk teams face,” the analysts wrote.</p>\n<p>“Worse yet,” they continued, “many governance, risk, and compliance programs hyperfocus on compliance, completely ignore risk, and scramble to stand up governance for every new emerging risk, technology, or threat. The 3LOD model is not built to solve this. “</p>\n<p>They explained that 3LOD was developed as a corporate governance framework to implement segregation of duties requirements under the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Then, in 2013, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) promoted it as a solution to enhance risk management. “But as anyone who has tried to implement it as a foundation for enterprise risk management will tell you, the 3LOD is not a model for managing risk,” the analysts wrote.</p>\n<h3>Rigid Framework</h3>\n<p>The framework is designed to meet the compliance requirements set by SOX, not deal with business risks, noted Ian Amit, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.gomboc.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gomboc</a>, a provider of automated cloud infrastructure security solutions in New York City.</p>\n<p>“It’s not adaptive enough to work for most modern organizations, where reporting lines and hierarchy aren’t as rigid as they used to be in 2000,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The 3LOD framework is a fairly old approach that the financial sector used and likely still does,” added Brian Betterton, practice director for risk and strategic services at <a href=\"https://www.guidepointsecurity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GuidePoint Security</a>, a cybersecurity services provider in Herndon, Va.</p>\n<p>“3LOD is not what I would call a modern approach, but some like it as it creates separation and thus splits risk management across three functions,” he told TechNewsWorld. “To me, 3LOD is more of an audit approach than a risk one.”</p>\n<p>He also pointed out that because of the audit nature of its controls, it has a point-in-time focus and not the continuous approach found in solutions focusing on business risk.</p>\n<h3>Compliance Trumps Risk</h3>\n<p>Many risk management programs are hyper-focused on compliance over actual risk for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>“Traditional risk management approaches tend to focus on compliance — passing the audit and checking the boxes — rather than actual business risk,” Amit said. “These approaches are often taken by organizations with leadership more concerned with preserving the current status quo than driving revenues or innovation.”</p>\n<p>“Often risk management programs focus more on compliance because it’s tangible and tied to clear goals,” added Nicole Sundin, CPO of <a href=\"https://axio.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Axio</a>, a cyber risk management company in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Compliance work is usually linked to a business objective or external requirement,” she told TechNewsWorld. “In this context, compliance becomes a point-in-time effort aimed at meeting a specific business need, rather than an ongoing process of identifying and mitigating evolving risks.”</p>\n<p>In addition, most risk management programs are driven by compliance goals, added Chandrasekhar Bilugu, CTO of <a href=\"https://sure-shield.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SureShield</a>, a security, compliance, and integrity management software company, in Atlanta. “Organizations seldom take up risk management as an independent process disconnected from compliance mandates, as it would lack the necessary executive sponsorship,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Heath Renfrow, CISO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://fenix24.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fenix24</a>, a disaster recovery and restoration company in Chattanooga, Tenn., asserted that compliance-driven risk management programs are nothing more than paper drills with no sound way of quantifying the risks for senior executives to make risk-based decisions. “You cannot manage risks that you do not understand,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Betterton noted that in less mature organizations, risk management programs tend to focus on compliance over risk. “Less mature organizations are viewing compliance as their main risk and, in turn, missing all of the risks they may have,” he said.</p>\n<p>Meeting compliance requirements is also easier for many organizations than assessing security needs. “Compliance means that you are complying with a rule or a regulation that must be followed. There are clear definitions of what must be followed,” explained Ira Winkler, CISO at <a href=\"https://cyesec.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CYE</a>, a cybersecurity optimization company in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>\n<p>“However, what it means to be secure varies greatly,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If you have no idea what security means for your organization, while you do have a clear definition of what it means to be compliant, you are obviously first going to achieve compliance because it is hard to be secure when you don’t exactly understand what that means.”</p>\n<h3>Foundation of Modern Risk Management</h3>\n<p>Scott and Valente cited three pillars for a modern approach to risk management.</p>\n<p>The approach must be dynamic and able to deal with risk in three dimensions: systemic risk external to the organization and beyond its control; ecosystem risk external to the organization but within varying degrees of control, such as third-party and supply chain risk; and enterprise risks internal to the organization and directly controllable, such as cybersecurity and financial risk.</p>\n<p>Further, the approach must be continuous because risks and opportunities evolve over time. Point-in-time, static risk assessments don’t reflect reality, the analysts explained. Instead, teams require a continuous process to identify risk context, assess it as plans and objectives develop, make decisions, and monitor the results.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The approach must also recognize that cyber risk is business risk. The analysts noted that typically, the chief risk officer selects the risk management model, while the CISO needs to ensure that the model is functional for the organization’s cybersecurity needs. Without working in lockstep, security, and risk pros are stuck living in fear from audit to audit while foreseeable, preventable risk events materialize repeatedly.</p>\n<p>“The chief risk officer and chief information security officer need to be on the same page when implementing a risk framework because both are responsible for identifying and addressing different aspects of risk within the organization,” Sundin observed.</p>\n<p>“The CRO typically focuses on overall business and operational risks, while the CISO focuses on cybersecurity risks. However, both roles have overlapping responsibilities when it comes to managing risk, and their teams possess crucial insights that must be shared to effectively address and mitigate risks.”</p>\n<p>“Collaboration between the CRO and CISO ensures a holistic approach to risk management, enabling the organization to proactively identify, assess, and resolve potential threats across all domains,” she said. “When their efforts are aligned, it fosters a unified, comprehensive risk strategy that reduces vulnerabilities and enhances the overall resilience of the business.”</p>\n<h3>Forrester’s Model</h3>\n<p>Scott and Valente also touted Forrester’s continuous risk management model, which they hailed as “a blueprint for holistic risk management.”</p>\n<p>Forrester’s approach isn’t completely new, Amit noted. “It mimics how modern organizations manage risk,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The introduction of tools that allow an organization to get more frequent data points on its internal controls and processes, as well as external threats, allow for more granular risk management that is more continuous than periodical,” he explained.</p>\n<p>He also pointed out that the audit and compliance requirements force organizations to implement more continuous evidence-gathering and controls, which allow them, in turn, to practice more pronounced risk management on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, people need to understand what risk management and security are, Winkler advised. “The definition of security is being free from risk, and you can never be free of all risk.”</p>\n<p>“Security professionals need to understand that their job is essentially risk management, which involves making the best decisions to optimize their spend compared to the amount of the potential loss,” he continued. “This requires good decision science and mathematical tools to help. This will drive their work from being an art to a science.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>While tariffs create a clear incentive to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., this is far from an easy task. Building up the kind of manufacturing capacity the U.S. once had will take decades, as it did in China.</p>\n<p>This week, we’ll examine why it is so difficult to reverse a trend that dates back to the breakup of RCA in the 1940s — marking manufacturing as a low government priority — an issue that can’t be fixed in a few years.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a hydrogen-powered horse robot (in prototype form) from Kawasaki named Corleo that should be far better than a motorcycle if it makes it to market.</p>\n<h3>Reshoring US Manufacturing Is Difficult</h3>\n<p>The call to “bring manufacturing back” resonates deeply in the American psyche, fueled by nostalgia for a perceived golden era, concerns about national security, and anxieties over global supply chain vulnerabilities. Electronics manufacturing, which encompasses everything from intricate semiconductors to consumer gadgets, is at the heart of this discussion.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the political rhetoric and popular support, reshoring complex electronics manufacturing to the U.S. borders on impossible in the near term. The reasons are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, stemming from decades of global economic shifts, strategic investments by competitors, and fundamental differences in infrastructure, workforce, and policy environments.</p>\n<h3>Why China Still Leads Electronics Manufacturing</h3>\n<p>China methodically built itself into the world’s workshop for decades, particularly for electronics. This dominance wasn’t accidental; it resulted from strategic planning and the cultivation of several key advantages that the U.S. currently cannot match.</p>\n<h4>Labor Dynamics and Scale</h4>\n<p>While often cited, the simple “cheap labor” argument is now oversimplified, though it was the initial catalyst. Chinese labor costs have risen significantly. However, the sheer scale of the available workforce, coupled with decades of experience, specifically in electronics assembly and production processes, creates efficiency and flexibility that is difficult to replicate.</p>\n<p>More importantly, this vast labor pool allowed for the creation of manufacturing ecosystems on a scale unseen elsewhere. Foxconn City in Shenzhen, employing hundreds of thousands of workers in a single integrated campus, exemplifies this scale. It’s a model with no parallel in the U.S. Even as automation increases, the existing skilled and semi-skilled labor base provides a foundation and adaptability critical for the rapid product cycles common in electronics.</p>\n<h4>Purpose-Built Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>China didn’t just attract factories; it built the entire logistical ecosystem to support them. This infrastructure includes massive, modern ports optimized for container shipping, extensive high-speed rail networks for domestic component transport, dedicated manufacturing zones with reliable utilities, and dense clusters of suppliers.</p>\n<p>Component manufacturers, mold makers, testing facilities, and assembly plants often exist in close geographic proximity, enabling rapid iteration, troubleshooting, and production scaling — a robust supply chain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>While extensive, the U.S. infrastructure is geared mainly toward consumer logistics and lacks the hyper-specialized, manufacturing-centric density found in regions like the Pearl River Delta or the Yangtze River Delta. Recreating such an integrated infrastructure in the U.S. would require decades and astronomical investment.</p>\n<h4>Robotics and Automation Adoption</h4>\n<p>Counterintuitively, China is also a leader in manufacturing automation. Facing rising labor costs and striving for higher precision, Chinese manufacturers, often aided by government initiatives, have invested heavily in robotics and advanced manufacturing technologies, rapidly increasing their robot density.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>They possess the scale for manual assembly when needed and increasingly sophisticated automated lines for high-volume, high-precision tasks. This combination of flexible manual labor capacity and advanced high-precision automation enables Chinese firms to stay competitive across a wide range of manufacturing complexities.</p>\n<p>While the U.S. has advanced automation capabilities, the <em>scale</em> of deployment within integrated electronics ecosystems lags behind China.</p>\n<h4>Aggressive Government Financial Support</h4>\n<p>The Chinese government has treated the development of its manufacturing sector, especially in strategic areas like electronics, as a national priority.</p>\n<p>To support this goal, it has provided massive, sustained financial support through various mechanisms: direct subsidies to manufacturers, low-interest loans from state-owned banks, tax incentives, government funding for research and development, land grants, and, sometimes, less tangible benefits like expedited regulatory approvals.</p>\n<p>This coordinated, long-term state backing created an environment where companies could invest heavily in capacity and technology with reduced financial risk, fostering the sector’s rapid growth. Organizations like the IMF have analyzed this approach as having significant trade implications.</p>\n<h3>Decades-Long Hollowing Out of U.S. Manufacturing</h3>\n<p>The rise of China’s manufacturing prowess coincided with a decades-long decline in U.S. manufacturing capacity, particularly in electronics assembly and component production — excluding some high-end areas like advanced semiconductor design. This wasn’t a sudden collapse but a slow bleed driven by corporations seeking lower production costs and focusing on design, marketing, and software — the higher-margin ends of the value chain.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The consequences are profound. Factories closed, equipment was sold off or scrapped, and crucially, entire generations of skilled manufacturing workers retired or moved into other sectors. The intricate networks of specialized suppliers that support complex manufacturing dwindled. Institutional knowledge — the practical expertise in running complex production lines, managing supply chains, and training technicians eroded.</p>\n<p>Rebuilding this isn’t just about constructing buildings; it’s about resurrecting an entire industrial ecosystem, complete with its human capital and specialized knowledge base. As <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2018/beyond-bls/the-fall-of-employment-in-the-manufacturing-sector.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis</a> suggests, millions of jobs were lost over decades. If it took decades to dismantle, it stands to reason that it will take decades to rebuild, assuming the will and resources are consistently available.</p>\n<h3>Immense Hurdles of Rebuilding: Time, Investment, and Policy</h3>\n<p>Even if the U.S. were to embark on a serious reshoring effort, the practical challenges are staggering.</p>\n<h4>Building Takes Time</h4>\n<p>Constructing a large-scale, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, like a modern semiconductor fabrication plant (fab), is a multi-year endeavor. It involves site selection, complex permitting processes (environmental, zoning), massive construction, installation of highly specialized equipment, and rigorous calibration and testing.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>A single fab can take three to five years or more, from groundbreaking to full production, costing upwards of $15-$20 billion, assuming no significant delays. To make a dent in reshoring electronics, the U.S. would need not just one but dozens of such large facilities, plus countless smaller suppliers — a monumental undertaking spanning decades.</p>\n<h4>Need for Long-Term, Unshakeable Incentives</h4>\n<p>Building these facilities requires colossal capital investment. Companies undertaking such investments need certainty regarding the long-term economic environment to ensure a return on investment. Incentives like tax breaks or tariff relief are often discussed. However, U.S. policy, particularly regarding trade and tariffs, has proven highly volatile, creating uncertainty that disrupts predictability and discourages investment.</p>\n<p>Tariffs implemented by one administration can be altered or removed by the next or even adjusted month-to-month based on geopolitical shifts or trade negotiations. For a factory with a 10–20-year payback period, the risk that crucial incentives could disappear within a single presidential term is a major deterrent.</p>\n<p>Investors require policy stability that extends far beyond typical election cycles — something historically difficult to guarantee in the U.S. system. Without credible, long-term, and perhaps even legislatively locked-in incentives, the financial risks of massive reshoring investments are often too high for private companies to bear alone.</p>\n<h3>US Lacks Skilled Labor for Electronics Work</h3>\n<p>Beyond physical infrastructure and policy, there’s the human element.</p>\n<h4>Skills Gap</h4>\n<p>Decades of de-emphasis on manufacturing have led to a significant mismatch between the skills needed for advanced electronics manufacturing and those prevalent in the U.S. workforce.</p>\n<p>Modern electronics production requires highly skilled technicians proficient in robotics, process control, cleanroom protocols, quality assurance, specialized equipment maintenance, and engineers with deep expertise in manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>While the U.S. excels in design and engineering, the pipeline for skilled manufacturing technicians and engineers has shrunk considerably. In contrast, China produces vastly more engineers and technicians annually, many specifically trained for manufacturing roles, although challenges remain in aligning skills with industry needs globally.</p>\n<p>Rebuilding America’s vocational and technical training systems to meet this demand will require long-term investment and a shift in educational and cultural priorities.</p>\n<h4>Workforce Discrepancy</h4>\n<p>There’s a stark contrast between public sentiment and individual career choices. Surveys consistently show overwhelming public support (around 80%) for bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., a sentiment that holds across party lines and contexts. Yet only 20%–25% say they would consider working in a factory.</p>\n<p>This disconnect reflects changing career aspirations, perceptions (sometimes outdated, though improving according to some studies) of factory work as monotonous or physically demanding, and the availability of jobs in the service, tech, and gig economies.</p>\n<p>Even with training programs and improving perceptions, attracting and retaining a sufficient number of workers willing to take on demanding manufacturing roles, potentially at wages that must still compete globally (even with automation), presents a significant social and economic challenge.</p>\n<h3>Catching Up: The Price Tag of Reshoring</h3>\n<p>China’s manufacturing dominance was built on decades of massive, state-directed investment, which created systemic advantages and sometimes led to global overcapacity issues. For the U.S. to catch up, particularly in a mature industry where China already has established economies of scale and integrated ecosystems, the required investment would likely need to be even <em>larger</em> and more sustained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Closing that gap isn’t just about subsidizing factory construction. While initiatives like the CHIPS Act represent important progress, they address only a portion of the broader manufacturing ecosystem. Achieving true competitiveness would require coordinated public and private investment in workforce development, infrastructure, supply chains, and advanced manufacturing capabilities.</p>\n<p>Sustaining such an effort over decades would demand a level of political consensus and fiscal commitment that is historically difficult to maintain in the U.S.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>The desire to reshore electronics manufacturing is understandable and driven by legitimate economic and security concerns. However, the practical realities paint a picture of immense difficulty, particularly in the near term.</p>\n<p>China’s entrenched advantages in scale, infrastructure, government support, and, increasingly, automation create a formidable barrier. Decades of U.S. manufacturing decline have left deep gaps in physical capacity, supply chains, and skilled human capital.</p>\n<p>Rebuilding requires not only time — years to build individual plants and decades to reconstruct ecosystems and workforces — but also unprecedented levels of sustained investment and, critically, long-term policy stability that is antithetical to recent U.S. political history.</p>\n<p>While targeted investments in strategic niches like advanced semiconductors are possible and underway, the wholesale return of the broad electronics manufacturing ecosystem seen in Asia remains, for the foreseeable future, an aspiration facing near-insurmountable obstacles. It’s a multi-decade marathon requiring unwavering national commitment, not a sprint that can be won with short-term policies or wishful thinking.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\"></p>\n<h3>Corleo: Kawasaki’s Hydrogen-Powered Horse Robot</h3>\n<p>Imagine a future where transportation isn’t limited to wheels or wings, but steps confidently over rough terrain. Kawasaki is bringing that vision closer with “Corleo,” a fascinating hydrogen-powered, rideable quadruped robot — essentially, a robotic horse unveiled for Expo 2025 Osaka. This isn’t just science fiction — it’s a glimpse into practical future applications, as seen in Kawasaki’s concept video:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Kawasaki CORLEO\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQDhzbTz-9k\" width=\"100%\" height=\"445\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Why a robot horse? Think about the advantages. Real horses are incredibly sure-footed and capable of navigating landscapes that would stop most motorcycles or ATVs cold. However, they require significant upkeep — feeding, stabling, and veterinary care — while motorcycles lack that all-terrain agility.</p>\n<p>Corleo aims for the best of both worlds: the potential sure-footedness of a quadruped — similar to advancements seen in other four-legged robots — combined with the lower maintenance of a machine powered cleanly by a 150cc hydrogen engine that generates electricity for its legs.</p>\n<p>The potential applications are exciting. Corleo could be invaluable for remote rescue operations. Picture sending a team of these into disaster areas or rugged wilderness where vehicles can’t reach. If developed with autonomous capabilities, Corleo could even venture into dangerous zones alone to locate and extract individuals, minimizing risk to human rescuers.</p>\n<h4>Future Possibilities for Kawasaki’s Robot Horse</h4>\n<p>Beyond rescue, imagine other uses: military transport in challenging environments (effectively bringing back the cavalry, but robotic!), unique, eco-friendly tour vehicles offering silent traversal through nature parks, or even as a fascinating, low-maintenance alternative for someone wanting an exotic pet without the biological demands.</p>\n<p>What could Corleo evolve into? Perhaps faster, more agile versions, integrated with advanced AI for complex tasks or specialized models for specific industries. It represents a stepping stone toward more versatile and adaptable robotic mobility, though the current capabilities are limited compared to the concept vision.</p>\n<p>Honestly, forget the sports car — a hydrogen-powered robot horse that can traverse mountains? Now <em>that</em> would make an incredible birthday gift for someone adventurous (hint: my birthday is coming up).</p>\n<p>Kawasaki’s Corleo isn’t just a robot; it’s a four-legged stride into the future — and my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A multinational study on the state of artificial intelligence in secondary and higher education released Tuesday found that students are more concerned about the impact of the technology on their learning than academic administrators and educators.</p>\n<p>The study, based on a survey of 3,500 academic administrators, students, and educators in seven nations, found that more than three out of five students (64%) worry about the use of AI in education, compared to 50% of educators and 41% of academic administrators.</p>\n<p>Top AI risks for educators and students were overreliance on the technology and potential loss of critical thinking skills, while prime risks for administrators were data privacy and security breaches, according to the survey conducted by <a href=\"https://www.vansonbourne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vanson Bourne</a> for <a href=\"https://www.turnitin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turnitin</a>, an academic integrity and assessment solutions company, in Oakland, Calif.</p>\n<p>“I’m not surprised that students were concerned, but the depth of their concern was surprising to me,” said Turnitin’s Senior Director for Customer Engagement, Patti West-Smith.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at the way the numbers shook out, that they expressed more concern about AI than admins or instructors,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Erosion of Critical Thinking</h3>\n<p>Karen Kovacs North, a clinical professor of communication at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://annenberg.usc.edu/\">Annenberg</a> School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, said that if students are concerned about AI, it isn’t stopping them from using it to complete assigned work.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, she told TechNewsWorld, “It’s heartening to know that students are now embracing the idea that critical thinking is what’s lost when they hand off problem-solving to AI.”</p>\n<p>“If students have an increasing understanding and appreciation of their own critical thinking and their own ability to problem solve, then we’re at least moving toward a better world where people will do their own problem solving and critical thinking.”</p>\n<p>Nearly half the students in the survey (49%) said they worry about becoming overreliant on AI, while more than half (59%) fret about overreliance on <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/are-gen-ai-benefits-worth-the-risk-178484.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI reducing their critical thinking skills</a>.</p>\n<p>“Reading and writing are two fundamental ways that people make meaning of new information, so if you get into a situation where a student is over-relying on AI, they’re outsourcing a lot of meaning-making that they would normally be doing,” West-Smith explained.</p>\n<p>“The danger there is that if you outsource the reading and writing, you might also outsource the thinking that goes into reading and writing,” she said. “The result of that is you might learn less because you are turning over your thinking process to the technology.”</p>\n<h3>Overuse of AI Weakens Thinking Skills</h3>\n<p>Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president of <a href=\"https://riseopp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RiseOpp</a>, a San Francisco marketing agency specializing in chief marketing officer services, maintained that overreliance on AI risks displacing the cognitive friction that critical thinking depends on.</p>\n<p>“When students defer too quickly to machine-generated answers, they may engage less in evaluating assumptions, weighing evidence, or forming independent judgments,” he told TechNewsWorld. “These are foundational to learning.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“I think of critical thinking as a muscle. It needs to be regularly exercised,” added Ryan Trattner, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.studyfetch.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StudyFetch</a>, an AI-powered learning platform in Los Angeles. “If students are not properly reasoning and evaluating information on a regular basis, this muscle will atrophy.”</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to see an entire generation of students who just magically makes answers appear without any effort,” he told TechNewsWorld. “When browsing the internet and looking for answers, it was still similar to a library. You had to find and read the information, but it wasn’t exactly answering your question, so you had to interpret and understand it, and then apply what you learned to answer a question. That is not the case with AI, where it’s just a simple copy and paste with zero critical thinking.”</p>\n<h3>Wide Agreement on AI Misuse</h3>\n<p>An overwhelming number of survey participants (95%) felt that AI was being misused. “The risk of intentional misuse will always exist with generative AI,” Turnitin Chief Product Officer Annie Chechitelli said in a statement. “Transparency throughout the student writing process enables educators to leverage the opportunities that AI technologies present while upholding the integrity of original student work.”</p>\n<p>“It can be helpful to have students do more of their writing in class, where it’s more difficult for them to use AI since they risk getting caught, but should we be teaching defensively and coming up with strategies that anticipate cheating?” asked <a href=\"https://camd.northeastern.edu/people/dan-kennedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Kennedy</a>, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think so,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Maybe having students produce a few writing samples in class at the beginning of the semester would be helpful, but overall, I’m uncomfortable with the idea of assuming my students will cheat.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>AI is a huge challenge for people at universities because it is so enticing for students to get their homework done fast, added North. “It puts a burden on faculty to come up with assignments that will challenge students to approach a problem in a uniquely individual way,” she said. “I always try to come up with problems that would be very hard for AI to solve, but it’s exhausting to try to figure out how to circumvent AI.”</p>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, maintains that misuse can be reduced through clear guidelines, ethical training, and early integration of AI literacy into the curriculum. “Educators should model responsible AI use and encourage students to see AI as a tool for exploration, not automation,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Getting the Most From AI</h3>\n<p>The survey also noted that while organizations may be expecting an AI-ready future workforce, more than two-thirds of the students surveyed (67%) felt they are shortcutting their learning by using AI. In addition to feeling they are shortcutting learning, 50% of students report not knowing how to get the most benefit from AI in their studies.</p>\n<p>“Often schools are falling behind in their understanding of how to use these systems, and by extension, how to help students get the most out of AI,” said Matt Mittelsteadt, a technology policy research fellow at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank.</p>\n<p>“To fill the gap, I’d encourage students to look to YouTube and other free-to-use online learning platforms,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Today there is a growing wealth of free resources on AI use cases, prompting techniques and limitations that students should dive into to fill the gaps in their education.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“I’d also recommend students investigate more ‘bespoke’ use cases of AI that could really supercharge their learning,” he added. “Machine translation, for instance, is now largely mature, opening the door for students to translate novel primary sources, follow international news, and engage with unique information sources that previously would have been walled behind a language barrier.”</p>\n<p>Vena added: “Students can derive the greatest benefit from employing artificial intelligence to augment — not supplant — their learning process. This entails utilizing AI for feedback, brainstorming, and conceptual clarification while simultaneously maintaining engagement and reflective thinking throughout the learning journey.”</p>\n<h3>Need To Reimagine Education for the AI Era</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.njit.edu/profile/bader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Bader</a>, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, N.J., maintained that society is at an inflection point that requires reimagining education, not just adding AI as another tool in the existing framework.</p>\n<p>“The key question isn’t whether to use AI, but how to evolve education to prepare students for a world where AI is ubiquitous,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This means shifting emphasis from fact memorization to higher-order thinking skills that complement rather than compete with AI capabilities.”</p>\n<p>“It means reconsidering assessment fundamentally — what are we measuring and why?” he continued. “It means acknowledging that literacy now includes understanding algorithmic influences on information.”</p>\n<p>“Most importantly, we need to maintain focus on the uniquely human aspects of education — the creativity, ethical reasoning, and interpersonal skills that remain distinctly human domains,” he said. “AI should amplify these capacities, not replace them.”</p>\n<p>“Educational institutions have a responsibility to model thoughtful AI implementation, being neither uncritically enthusiastic nor fearfully resistant,” he added. “The decisions we make now about AI in education will shape not just learning outcomes but society’s relationship with these powerful technologies for years to come.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AI will become the new UI, spending will increase to counter disinformation, and increased use of Earth intelligence gathered from space will be disruptive technologies in the near future, according to a report released Monday by global technology research firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>.</p>\n<p>The three technologies were among 12 that Gartner predicted would define the future of business systems. Technology leaders must prioritize these over the next five years, as they present competitive opportunities in the near term and will eventually grow to become standard throughout businesses, Gartner contended.</p>\n<p>“Technology leaders must take action now to gain a first-mover advantage with these technologies,” Gartner Vice President Analyst Bill Ray said in a statement. “Innovative advancements like generative-AI-enabled code architecture, <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/think-tank-issues-guidance-for-ai-policymakers-179205.html\">disinformation security</a>, and Earth intelligence will provide the differentiation needed to help enterprises pull ahead of the pack in terms of data and product offerings.”</p>\n<h3>AI Replaces Staid UI</h3>\n<p>Gartner maintained that gen-AI solutions using free-form text and multimedia inputs/outputs will displace the conventional form-oriented sequential UI in established enterprise applications and enable new user scenarios.</p>\n<p>A user interface provides a way for a human to navigate and communicate with a machine naturally, explained Sandi Besen, an applied AI researcher at IBM and <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.neudesic.com\">Neudesic</a>, a global professional services company. “Since language models enable a system to communicate with humans natively through voice, text, or visually, we might not have as much need for a ‘user interface’ the way we know it today,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“If you can interact with the computer using natural language, you don’t really need a secondary UI,” said Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“The AI becomes your user interface,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Much like you don’t need Windows to talk to someone else, you won’t need a UI to interact with your computer.”</p>\n<p>Besen pointed out, however, that some things are still difficult to control, like input validation, without a UI. “We are seeing the emergence of a ‘dynamic UI’ that adapts based on the inputs the user needs to provide the LLM rather than forcing the user to follow a predefined flow,” she said.</p>\n<p>Gartner Vice President Analyst Ray Valdes added in a statement, “To remain competitive, traditional enterprise application software vendors will need to refactor applications to serve composable gen-AI solutions that are invoked on demand via textual and multimodal prompts.”</p>\n<p>Because of that, Gartner predicts that by 2029, more than 50% of user interactions linked to enterprise business processes will leverage large language models to bypass the UI layer in traditional enterprise applications, up from less than 5% today.</p>\n<h3>New Interest in Disinformation Security</h3>\n<p>Gartner also predicts that by 2030, at least half of enterprises will have adopted products or services to address disinformation security, up from less than 5% in 2024.</p>\n<p>It explained that disinformation security is an emerging discipline focused on threats from outside the corporate-controlled network. It includes a suite of technologies, such as <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/how-deepfakes-are-undermining-mobile-commerce-security-178221.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deepfake detection</a>, impersonation prevention, and reputation protection, that can address disinformation to help enterprises discern trust, protect their brand, and secure their online presence.</p>\n<p>“Attackers are using AI to impersonate executives, manipulate communications, and erode confidence in what people see and hear online,” said Patrick Tiquet, vice president for security and architecture at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“For enterprises, this means protecting infrastructure isn’t enough,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They also need to secure the people behind it, ensuring digital interactions remain authentic and trusted.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Ishpreet Singh, chief information officer at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blackduck.com\">Black Duck Software</a>, an applications security company in Burlington, Mass., explained that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence technologies, such as deepfakes, generative AI, and <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/bots-now-dominate-the-web-and-thats-a-problem-179563.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">automated bots</a>, enables malicious actors to create highly realistic and targeted false narratives at unprecedented scale and speed.</p>\n<p>“These sophisticated disinformation campaigns can quickly influence public perception, distort market realities, and undermine organizational credibility, directly threatening brand value and long-term stakeholder trust,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Gartner Senior Director Analyst Alfredo Ramirez IV added in a statement: “Disinformation attacks use external infrastructure like social media and originate from areas with limited legal oversight. Tech leaders must add ‘disinformation-proofing’ to products by using AI/machine learning for content verification and data provenance tracking to help users discern the truth.”</p>\n<h3>Earth Intelligence for Business Insights</h3>\n<p>Gartner also predicts that by 2028, 80% of major Earth surface assets globally will be monitored by active satellites.</p>\n<p>Earth intelligence uses AI to analyze satellite, aerial, and ground data to monitor Earth’s assets and activities, providing insights for decision-making, it explained. “That doesn’t mean maps and charts,” Ray said. “Earth intelligence is delivering numbers on global nickel production, theme park revenue, and the health of wheat crops, to name just a few.”</p>\n<p>Earth intelligence also includes accurate weather forecasting. “Weather events can adversely impact logistics and supply chains, so being able to better predict them should allow companies to more effectively assure their operations,” Enderle noted.</p>\n<p>“In addition,” he continued, “weather events can put sites, customers, and employees at risk, so having a better predictive tool will allow companies to better protect these assets.”</p>\n<p>Given the breadth of applications, Gartner maintained that Earth intelligence is applicable to all industries and enterprises. Defense has been the first adopter, but improvements in data quality and analysis techniques have rapidly expanded the use cases.</p>\n<p>“Earth intelligence applies to every business,” Ray added. “Enterprises can gain an early advantage by creatively and strategically applying Earth intelligence to significantly enhance specific functionalities of existing systems or to compete via net new capabilities.”</p>\n<h3>Disruptive Dozen</h3>\n<p>Gartner organized its Disruptive Dozen into four categories: Application, Infrastructure, Data, and Security.</p>\n<p>Application disrupters include intelligent simulation, AI-composed applications, and polyfunctional robots.</p>\n<p>“Polyfunctional robots will be capable of performing an increasing number of jobs currently done by humans,” Enderle said. “Putting in place the support structure for these robots and programs to retrain or eliminate the then redundant employees will require a great deal of planning, time, and effort and will certainly disrupt operations during implementation, particularly if the site is unionized.”</p>\n<p>Infrastructure disrupters include algorithm-aligned silicon, low power/high compute, and sensor fusion.</p>\n<p>Among the data disrupters are Earth intelligence, hypersynthetic data, and domain language models. “Hypersynthetic data will make creating LLMs far easier and faster,” Enderle said. “However, the potential for this data to be unreliable increases significantly the farther you get from data with a more factual foundation. Quality has suffered significantly during the AI rollout, and hypersynthetic data could increase that exposure significantly.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Besen explained that domain language models are LLMs trained extensively within a “domain” of knowledge rather than on general data like GPT-4o.</p>\n<p>“They will be important, particularly for tasks that require a very deep understanding of specialized subjects like biology or chemistry, and which don’t require knowledge or the ability to reason outside their specific domain,” she said. “A domain model for biology might be excellent for interpreting patient symptoms and explaining a physician’s diagnosis to a user — but not helping them plan their upcoming travel itinerary.”</p>\n<p>Security disrupters include digital ethics, disinformation security, and preemptive cybersecurity. “Preemptive cybersecurity stands out because it shifts security from reaction to prediction,” Tiquet explained.</p>\n<p>“As threat actors increasingly weaponize AI and automation, waiting for an alert is no longer enough,” he continued. “Preemptive systems use AI-driven insights to uncover vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and anomalies before they’re exploited.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a disruptive change because it forces organizations to rethink traditional tools and adopt continuous, intelligent threat anticipation across every layer — from endpoints to identities to cloud workloads,” he said.</p>\n<p>Singh added, “This forward-looking approach is especially critical in today’s ever-evolving digital landscape, where the increasing complexity of interconnected systems — including IoT devices, cloud services, and remote work platforms — creates a broader and more intricate array of security challenges.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Because of Intel’s relative weakness at the moment, Arm has an opportunity to move outside of its smartphone base and solidly into PCs. Instead of backing Qualcomm’s play, Arm has decided to cancel Qualcomm’s license. This move not only appears to be an abuse of power but is extremely ill-timed, given Intel and AMD have correctly identified the threat and formed a partnership to fight it.</p>\n<p>It suggests that maybe Qualcomm shouldn’t have blocked Nvidia’s attempt to buy Arm because, to get government approvals for the deal, Nvidia would have had to protect Qualcomm’s interests and be blocked from doing what Arm is now doing to Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>Further, Arm is at risk even for smartphones because the hottest smartphone currently on the market is from Huawei. It doesn’t use an Arm processor but a Kirin processor, which, on paper, might be better. My Product of the Week is a Huawei phone pulling interest in line with the original iPhone. So, this Arm vs. Qualcomm war is ill-timed.</p>\n<h3>Qualcomm’s PC Effort Is Struggling</h3>\n<p>While there is a lot of focus coming out of Huawei from Qualcomm on the performance of the new Snapdragon processors for laptops, the big problem for them isn’t performance but compatibility. This compatibility issue, while not pronounced for those of us who don’t use many custom apps, has become a bridge too far for large companies with a lot of custom Windows apps.</p>\n<p>In addition, over the last few months, AMD and Intel have stepped up their laptop processor game. While Qualcomm can still successfully argue it’s better in terms of efficiency, the need for emulators detracts from this, and x86 is the entrenched technology. This means all Intel and AMD need to be is good enough, but Qualcomm has to outperform them.</p>\n<p>One critical mistake was the failure to drive more 5G capability into these Snapdragon notebooks. Qualcomm’s biggest advantages are its wireless capability and powering a laptop that has not only all-day battery life but also instant and pervasive connectivity. However, only the Microsoft Surface Tablet has this capability.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Coincidentally, I understand that the Surface Snapdragon AI PC products are significantly outselling everyone else’s, suggesting that 5G capability was a significant potential game changer.</p>\n<p>One of the significant reasons the line is struggling is that it is both different and not well-marketed. When a product is different, its marketing requirement is higher because we don’t like different unless that difference has key benefits.</p>\n<p>For instance, the LG Prada phone (on which the first iPhone was allegedly based) didn’t sell well because people didn’t like virtual keyboards and preferred phones like the Blackberry. But Apple marketed the consumer benefits of a screen phone and pivoted the market to it, knocking dominant companies like Palm, Research In Motion (Blackberry), and even Microsoft out of the market.</p>\n<p>That’s the power of well-funded and fully executed marketing, and we just didn’t see that with these offerings.</p>\n<h3>The x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group</h3>\n<p>Intel and AMD recently formed the <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-15-intel-and-amd-form-x86-ecosystem-advisory-group-to-accelerate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group</a> to defend against Arm and any other challenging technology. This group has pretty much every major PC OEM within it, as well as several server and web providers, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>This is a “hell froze over” type of relationship, given AMD and Intel have been at each other’s throats for years. But these two competitors rightly saw the risk, put aside their differences, and moved collectively against the Arm threat.</p>\n<p>While the group is still too young to make much progress, it provides significant resources with the goal of not only blocking Arm from entering the broader computing ecosystem but also the potential to challenge Arm for tablets and potentially smartphone alternatives in the future.</p>\n<p>Arm should have moved immediately to consolidate its licensees into a similar group, much like the partnerships formed during wars where countries put aside their differences to address the broader threat. Instead, Arm decided to go to war with Qualcomm. This would be like Russia in World War II deciding to bomb the United Kingdom while being invaded by Germany. The outcome of that war would likely have been very different.</p>\n<h3>The Huawei Threat</h3>\n<p>Right now, Huawei is contained because of its alleged close relationship with the Chinese government. Nonetheless, its products have for some time had significant price and performance advantages that appear to be increasing.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Much like the electric car companies in China have started to outstrip even Tesla, Chinese companies appear to be advancing far quicker than their Western counterparts. Should relations ease again between the West and the East, Western tech companies like Arm, Qualcomm, and Tesla will be at greater risk.</p>\n<p>This situation is a threat to Arm’s and Qualcomm’s current core markets, making this conflict between the two companies not only ill-timed but incredibly stupid because it puts a cloud over both companies’ futures.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Arm has significant potential to redefine the personal computing space, but so do x86 and challengers like Huawei. This is not a time to launch preemptive attacks on licensees; it is time to gather them to counter the AMD and Intel Advisory Group effort.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>This fight between Arm and Qualcomm has the potential to create the same kind of dynamic that resulted in the iPhone taking out Nokia, Blackberry, and Palm, among others, and destroying the otherwise bright future of both firms.</p>\n<p>Let’s hope the adults eventually step in because should this fight continue to escalate, it won’t end well for either firm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Huawei Tri-Fold Mate XT Smartphone</h3>\n<p>The Huawei Tri-Fold Mate XT may just be the most amazing smartphone launched so far.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Chinese and Huawei sanctions and restrictions, this phone is available only in China for now, but it has Samsung worried and again points to how far off the cutting-edge Apple is.</p>\n<p>This phone expands from a good-sized 6.4-inch screen to a whopping 10.2-inch tablet, creating an iPhone and an iPad in one device. Its cameras are as good or better than any premium phone in the market, and when folded, it has nearly the same thickness as a single-screen phone.</p>\n<p>Given it has only two hinges, the “tri” refers to the number of screens, not the number of hinges. The phone can be used with a single screen, a double screen with the spare screen on the back, or with all three screens as needed. The UI, which is based on Huawei’s Harmony OS (not Android), handles all three configurations with ease.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HUAWEI Mate XT ULTIMATE DESIGN - Crafted with Excellence\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe5dJCRWifo\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One shortcoming is battery size. It has a small, smartphone-sized battery, not a tablet-sized battery, giving it a relatively short battery life in tablet mode. Another shortcoming is the price, nearly $3,000, making it one of the most expensive phones out there.</p>\n<p>It isn’t waterproof, and the screens are relatively fragile. Screen protectors typically don’t work well on foldable phones. You can gray market buy it on eBay, but with prices often pushing a whopping $10,000 and little compatibility outside of China, even I wouldn’t buy one that way. But the massive premium prices suggest enough people want this phone to justify that unaffordable price.</p>\n<p>Shortcomings aside, this thing draws a crowd because there is nothing quite like it. Plus, it may show how Qualcomm, assuming it survives the Arm insanity, could move more aggressively on the PC market by creating a different class of PC, much like the iPhone initially was a different class of smartphone, similar to what Huawei is doing with the Trifold. Embrace the difference and push it with a uniquely interesting design.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm is the only processor company with something that could effectively compete with the Kirin processor in this phone. If the Arm community doesn’t step up to this threat, they may wish they’d studied what Apple did to Nokia more deeply. In the end, even though I can’t use it, I have lust in my heart for the Huawei Mate XT Tri-Fold smartphone, and it is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>AI-driven systems have become prime targets for sophisticated cyberattacks, exposing critical vulnerabilities across industries. As organizations increasingly embed AI and machine learning (ML) into their operations, the stakes for securing these systems have never been higher. From data poisoning to adversarial attacks that can mislead AI decision-making, the challenge extends across the entire AI/ML lifecycle.</p>\n<p>In response to these threats, a new discipline, machine learning security operations (MLSecOps), has emerged to provide a foundation for robust AI security. Let’s explore five foundational categories within MLSecOps.</p>\n<h3>1. AI Software Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</h3>\n<p>AI systems rely on a vast ecosystem of commercial and open-source tools, data, and ML components, often sourced from multiple vendors and developers. If not properly secured, each element within the AI software supply chain, whether it’s datasets, pre-trained models, or development tools, can be exploited by malicious actors.</p>\n<p>The SolarWinds hack, which compromised multiple government and corporate networks, is a well-known example. Attackers infiltrated the software supply chain, embedding malicious code into widely used IT management software. Similarly, in the AI/ML context, an attacker could inject corrupted data or tampered components into the supply chain, potentially compromising the entire model or system.</p>\n<p>To mitigate these risks, MLSecOps emphasizes thorough vetting and continuous monitoring of the AI supply chain. This approach includes verifying the origin and integrity of ML assets, especially third-party components, and implementing security controls at every phase of the AI lifecycle to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced into the environment.</p>\n<h3>2. Model Provenance</h3>\n<p>In the world of AI/ML, models are often shared and reused across different teams and organizations, making model provenance — how an ML model was developed, the data it used, and how it evolved — a key concern. Understanding model provenance helps track changes to the model, identify potential security risks, monitor access, and ensure that the model performs as expected.</p>\n<p>Open-source models from platforms like Hugging Face or Model Garden are widely used due to their accessibility and collaborative benefits. However, open-source models also introduce risks, as they may contain vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit once they are introduced to a user’s ML environment.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>MLSecOps best practices call for maintaining a detailed history of each model’s origin and lineage, including an AI-Bill of Materials, or AI-BOM, to safeguard against these risks.</p>\n<p>By implementing tools and practices for tracking model provenance, organizations can better understand their models’ integrity and performance and guard against malicious manipulation or unauthorized changes, including but not limited to insider threats.</p>\n<h3>3. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)</h3>\n<p>Strong GRC measures are essential for ensuring responsible and ethical AI development and use. GRC frameworks provide oversight and accountability, guiding the development of fair, transparent, and accountable AI-powered technologies.</p>\n<p>The AI-BOM is a key artifact for GRC. It is essentially a comprehensive inventory of an AI system’s components, including ML pipeline details, model and data dependencies, license risks, training data and its origins, and known or unknown vulnerabilities. This level of insight is crucial because one cannot secure what one does not know exists.</p>\n<p>An AI-BOM provides the visibility needed to safeguard AI systems from supply chain vulnerabilities, model exploitation, and more. This MLSecOps-supported approach offers several key advantages, like enhanced visibility, proactive risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, and improved security operations.</p>\n<p>In addition to maintaining transparency through AI-BOMs, MLSecOps best practices should include regular audits to evaluate the fairness and bias of models used in high-risk decision-making systems. This proactive approach helps organizations comply with evolving regulatory requirements and build public trust in their AI technologies.</p>\n<h3>4. Trusted AI</h3>\n<p>AI’s growing influence on decision-making processes makes trustworthiness a key consideration in the development of machine learning systems. In the context of MLSecOps, trusted AI represents a critical category focused on ensuring the integrity, security, and ethical considerations of AI/ML throughout its lifecycle.</p>\n<p>Trusted AI emphasizes the importance of transparency and explainability in AI/ML, aiming to create systems that are understandable to users and stakeholders. By prioritizing fairness and striving to mitigate bias, trusted AI complements broader practices within the MLSecOps framework.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The concept of trusted AI also supports the MLSecOps framework by advocating for continuous monitoring of AI systems. Ongoing assessments are necessary to maintain fairness, accuracy, and vigilance against security threats, ensuring that models remain resilient. Together, these priorities foster a trustworthy, equitable, and secure AI environment.</p>\n<h3>5. Adversarial Machine Learning</h3>\n<p>Within the MLSecOps framework, adversarial machine learning (AdvML) is a crucial category for those building ML models. It focuses on identifying and mitigating risks associated with adversarial attacks.</p>\n<p>These attacks manipulate input data to deceive models, potentially leading to incorrect predictions or unexpected behavior that can compromise the effectiveness of AI applications. For example, subtle changes to an image fed into a facial recognition system could cause the model to misidentify the individual.</p>\n<p>By incorporating AdvML strategies during the development process, builders can enhance their security measures to protect against these vulnerabilities, ensuring their models remain resilient and accurate under various conditions.</p>\n<p>AdvML emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI systems throughout their lifecycle. Developers should implement regular assessments, including adversarial training and stress testing, to identify potential weaknesses in their models before they can be exploited.</p>\n<p>By prioritizing AdvML practices, ML practitioners can proactively safeguard their technologies and reduce the risk of operational failures.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>AdvML, alongside the other categories, demonstrates the critical role of MLSecOps in addressing AI security challenges. Together, these five categories highlight the importance of leveraging MLSecOps as a comprehensive framework to protect AI/ML systems against emerging and existing threats. By embedding security into every phase of the AI/ML lifecycle, organizations can ensure that their models are high-performing, secure, and resilient.</p>\n",

One of those people was Tom Mitchell, who unexpectedly passed away last November at the age of 76.</p>\n<p>I met Tom in February 1993 on a surprisingly pleasant weather day in Houston when I was interviewing for a product manager role at Compaq Computer Corporation. In those days, product manager candidates were put through an excruciating round of endurance-like interviews (I recall the number being nine or 10) in a single day, with your outcome being determined at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Tom was the last examiner during my day-long interview gauntlet. I could tell he was exhausted from other business earlier in the day. But it was a “good” type of busy as Compaq was in the throes of its second growth ascendancy after announcing its low-cost ProLinea desktop PC lineup in 1992 to take on low-cost PC clones.</p>\n<p>Despite his fatigue, I was immediately impressed by Tom’s inquisitive questions about my professional background, knowledge of the PC space, and perhaps most importantly, my interest in making inroads into the consumer PC space, which Compaq had big plans for. Always a “what you see is what you get” type of guy, we immediately clicked, and it became the start of a remarkable 31-year friendship.</p>\n<h3>Tom’s Program Management Expertise</h3>\n<p>Although his career reached senior executive levels at Compaq, and at the latter part of his career, Foxconn/Hon Hai (a key component and eventual PC manufacturer for Compaq), Tom was, first and foremost, the prototypical program manager. He was the best of the best in that department.</p>\n<p>Few people outside the tech space understand precisely what a program manager does.</p>\n<p>An excellent program manager at a tech products company seamlessly integrates cross-functional teams, ensuring projects are delivered on time, within scope and cost budget, and aligned with strategic goals. They excel at balancing technical understanding with business acumen, translating complex requirements into actionable plans.</p>\n<p>By proactively identifying risks and dependencies, they mitigate potential roadblocks before they escalate. Their strong communication skills foster collaboration across diverse stakeholders, from engineers to executives, ensuring transparency and alignment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, they are invaluable because they drive efficiency, clarity, and cohesion, enabling innovation to flourish in fast-paced, dynamic environments and deliver business results.</p>\n<h3>Driving Success at Compaq</h3>\n<p>These attributes became incredibly critical as Compaq’s consumer division grew to multi-billion revenue levels after its first consumer PCs — branded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Presario\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Presario</a> — were announced in August 1993.</p>\n<p>From a persona standpoint, those who knew Tom well would describe him as Compaq’s own “Walter Cronkite” — non-emotional, data-driven, always doing “the right thing,” and succinct in his messaging and communications. If Tom told you that aliens had landed on the roof of CCA 5 (one of Compaq’s early buildings in Spring, Texas), you’d believe him.</p>\n<p>But Tom was far more than just a great program manager. He was a great leader and manager of people, many of whom would view Tom as a role model or mentor in the latter parts of their careers. Even some great people managers often struggle with establishing personal friendships with their employees due to the risk of “crossing the line” between the workplace and people’s personal lives. Not Tom.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>Tom managed the Consumer Division in a co-GM format with fellow Compaq colleague Tony Dowzall and had no problem encouraging (if not participating) in company events that humanized him.</p>\n<p>In the late 1990s, we announced one of the first consumer desktop PCs with 1394 connectivity (Apple would call it Firewire). This new technology enabled high-speed transfers of large video files between digital video cameras and PCs, a breakthrough that led to PCs and Macs becoming video editing devices — something we take for granted in 2025.</p>\n<p>Tom and Tony agreed to play Dr. Evil and Austin Powers in an inter-company video, showing his lightheartedness and willingness to poke fun at himself. I wish I still had that video footage.</p>\n<p>Tom knew how to take calculated risks, too.</p>\n<p>While it seems quaint now, Compaq had an opportunity to work with AMD on announcing a technology demo of the world’s first 1Ghz desktop mini-tower using a liquid-based cooling solution that allowed us to demonstrate Compaq’s innovative ethos. While this was simply a demo shown off at CES, it required scarce engineering resources that Tom ensured were available to make this industry-first demo a reality.</p>\n<h3>A Life Built on Family and Values</h3>\n<p>Born in Scotland but spending his formative years growing up in Canada, Tom Mitchell was the consummate family man — a devoted father whose greatest joy came from his time with his loving wife, Becky, to whom he was married for 53 wonderful years.</p>\n<p>Tom and Becky moved so many times during their marriage that she dubbed him a “Scottish Gypsy.” Still, together, they built a life filled with warmth, laughter, and unwavering support.</p>\n<p>Tom was a proud father to two daughters, Jackie and Carie. He cherished every moment of their lives and always encouraged them with his wisdom and kindness. His deep love for his family is evident in everything he did, serving as a constant source of strength and inspiration to those closest to him.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Tom-Mitchell-family.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Mitchell and family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Tom-Mitchell-family.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Tom-Mitchell-family-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Tom-Mitchell-family-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The Mitchell family (L-R) Carie, Tom, Becky, and Jackie</p>\n<p>One thing about Tom that always stood out was his humility. He absolutely disdained attention. In a world where sports professionals, business leaders, politicians (and even industry analysts!) crave attention for their accomplishments, Tom let his accomplishments speak for themselves and was happy just playing golf with friends to let off some steam.</p>\n<h3>A Legacy in Technology and Beyond</h3>\n<p>Tom joined Compaq during a pivotal era, contributing his vast expertise and visionary thinking to a company reshaping the world of personal computing.</p>\n<p>His managerial style and unassuming approach were perfect for Compaq as its consumer business grew rapidly. The company had its share of internal critics who were not crazy that it was succeeding in a low-cost business but consuming resources from other divisions. But he navigated through corporate politics with aplomb and grace.</p>\n<p>A true technologist at heart, Tom possessed an innate curiosity that fueled his passion for innovation. He departed Compaq after its acquisition by HP to join Taiwan-based Foxconn/Hon Hai, where he worked at a senior level to identify new tech categories and solutions for multiple OEMs.</p>\n<p>Tom’s ability to foresee trends and adapt to the rapid changes in the IT landscape was unparalleled. He played a critical role in projects that advanced Compaq’s position as a leader in the industry, always approaching challenges with a blend of technical acumen and creative problem-solving.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>Beyond his professional achievements, Tom was revered for his unwavering integrity, generosity, and genuine kindness. He had a unique talent for making complex concepts accessible and fostering an environment of continuous learning and collaboration.</p>\n<p>His mentorship extended beyond technical guidance; he taught us the importance of resilience, humility, and staying true to one’s values amidst competitive industry pressures.</p>\n<p>Compaq colleagues fondly remember Tom’s infectious (if dry) sense of humor during team meetings, thoughtful insights during strategic discussions, and an ever-present willingness to lend an ear or offer sage advice. His leadership style was characterized by empathy and respect, empowering those around him to excel and grow professionally and personally.</p>\n<p>Tom’s legacy is not confined to the projects he led or the innovations he championed; it lives on in the countless individuals he influenced. His impact resonates in the culture of excellence he helped cultivate, the careers he shaped, and the enduring friendships he formed.</p>\n<p>In honoring Tom’s memory, I know people will celebrate his values: a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a commitment to excellence, impeccable family values, and a deep respect and care for those around him.</p>\n<h3>Remembering Tom’s Humor and Wisdom</h3>\n<p>I alluded earlier to Tom’s dry sense of humor. A prime example: when I completed my final interview at Compaq on that fateful day in Houston in 1993, Tom could tell that I was exhausted and gave me a few words of support. As I was walking out the door of his office, I asked him why so many people complained about the weather in Houston. With a twinkle in his eye, he told me, “Mark, you’ll love it here. The weather in Houston is like this year-round.”</p>\n<p>Tom, you will be missed by many!</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Over the last decade, AMD has undergone a remarkable transformation. From a company once struggling for relevance, it has risen under CEO Lisa Su’s steady and strategic leadership to become a serious contender across the data center, client computing, and now embedded and adaptive edge markets.</p>\n<p>One of AMD’s fastest-rising stars is its embedded business, now armed with a broad portfolio and a sharp focus on AI. As competitors like Intel falter, AMD’s differentiated approach could put it on a trajectory to gain significant market share, particularly at the embedded edge.</p>\n<h3>AMD’s Embedded Rebound and Push Into Edge AI</h3>\n<p>AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx laid the foundation for its embedded success. This purchase brought a robust adaptive computing portfolio — FPGAs, SoCs, and RF technologies — that AMD has tightly integrated with its x86 CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs.</p>\n<p>In an invite-only fireside chat with analysts last week, Salil Raje, SVP and GM of AMD’s Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group, the depth of that integration was on full display.</p>\n<p>Raje outlined AMD’s five-pillar strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fortifying its adaptive portfolio</li>\n<li>Improving usability for developers</li>\n<li>Growing x86 embedded market share</li>\n<li>Winning high-value custom silicon deals</li>\n<li>Leading in embedded AI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AMD isn’t just positioning itself as a component vendor — it’s becoming a “platform enabler” across industries like automotive, aerospace, communications, and robotics.</p>\n<h3>AMD’s Edge Over Intel in Embedded Strategy</h3>\n<p>It’s clear that AMD is not playing catch-up — it’s pushing ahead where others stall. AMD has achieved revenue leadership in adaptive computing, leaving Intel’s Altera (soon to be spun out again) in its wake.</p>\n<p>In embedded CPUs, AMD holds just a 7%-8% market share but sees that as an opportunity, not a weakness. Raje said, “We believe we can grow significantly faster in that business over the next four to five years.”</p>\n<p>What makes AMD’s approach stand out? Flexibility and openness. AMD’s edge strategy doesn’t depend on any single compute architecture. Instead, it uses a modular mix of x86, Arm, GPU, and FPGA — whatever the application demands.</p>\n<p>The company also avoids a black-box approach to AI software stacks, instead partnering with ecosystem players to keep platforms open and customizable. This open strategy contrasts sharply with more closed approaches from some of its competitors, particularly in automotive and robotics.</p>\n<h3>AI at the Edge: AMD’s Next Big Move</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most exciting element of AMD’s embedded strategy is its continued aggressive push into edge AI. “There will be a ChatGPT moment at the edge,” said Raje, and AMD wants to be ready for it.</p>\n<p>AMD is integrating NPUs into nearly every product, from AI PCs to embedded SoCs. The goal is simple: deliver low-latency, power-efficient AI acceleration in markets like industrial automation, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>AMD’s recent product launches reflect this vision.</p>\n<p>From the versatile Versal AI Edge Gen 2 — which fuses ARM cores, FPGA fabric, ISPs, and NPUs — to the powerful EPYC Turing 9005 with 192 Zen 5 cores, the company is scaling across performance tiers and verticals. It’s already winning sockets in security, networking, and auto sectors.</p>\n<p>Moreover, AMD’s AI software tools enable seamless migration from cloud-trained models to edge deployments, a unique value proposition that strengthens customer loyalty.</p>\n<h3>Custom Silicon: Playing Offense, Not Defense</h3>\n<p>AMD’s edge isn’t just in off-the-shelf products. Its custom silicon business, once limited to gaming consoles, is gaining traction across automotive, defense, and data center sectors. Importantly, AMD doesn’t pursue custom silicon unless it brings differentiated IP or platform value, such as integrating x86, GPU, or RF IP into unique packages. It’s a targeted, value-driven strategy that avoids commoditization.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Chiplets add another layer of flexibility. AMD’s leadership in chiplet architectures allows it to offer semi-custom solutions more cost-effectively, integrating customer IP on shared platforms. As chiplet adoption increases, AMD’s ability to modularize compute elements will become a powerful differentiator.</p>\n<h3>Leadership That Delivers</h3>\n<p>Much of AMD’s rise can be traced back to the discipline and strategic clarity of CEO Lisa Su. Her turnaround of the company isn’t a product of bold promises but of measured execution that prioritizes innovation, product roadmaps, and market focus. That same DNA is evident in AMD’s embedded and adaptive computing.</p>\n<p>Su’s leadership enabled AMD to avoid the pitfalls that have plagued Intel — missed process nodes, delays in AI strategy, and an overdependence on legacy business lines. AMD, by contrast, now delivers products that are often competitive but ahead of the curve, particularly in power-performance ratios and time-to-market in AI.</p>\n<h3>The Intel Factor: A Window of Opportunity</h3>\n<p>Intel’s struggles in recent years have opened the door for AMD. From manufacturing delays to uncertainty around the Altera spinout, Intel’s position in the embedded market is vulnerable. While Intel still dominates in x86 embedded CPUs, its distracted execution allows AMD to grab market share, especially with AI reshaping workloads at the edge.</p>\n<p>AMD’s strength in heterogenous computing, openness to Arm, and software-developer focus make it far more agile in responding to evolving edge AI needs than Intel’s more rigid portfolio. If AMD executes on its roadmap and continues to differentiate with a modular platform approach, it could become the go-to supplier for a broad swath of edge workloads.</p>\n<h3>A Platform for the Future</h3>\n<p>AMD’s embedded business is no longer just a side bet. It’s rapidly becoming a cornerstone of the company’s long-term growth strategy.</p>\n<p>Once viewed as a niche, the embedded market is now a critical front in the broader computing landscape, especially as AI workloads migrate from centralized data centers to distributed, real-time environments at the edge.</p>\n<p>Under Lisa Su’s direction, AMD’s leadership team has positioned the company to capitalize on this shift with discipline, clarity, and a sharp focus on execution.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The strategy is not just about having a broad portfolio but about how it works together. AMD is offering customers a consistent, scalable compute platform from cloud to edge, blending the flexibility of adaptive hardware with the performance of CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs.</p>\n<p>This point is especially relevant in today’s fragmented edge environments, where power efficiency, latency, and customization define competitive advantage. AMD’s modular approach, enabled by chiplets and customizable silicon, ensures customers can get precisely what they need without compromise.</p>\n<h3>AMD’s Opportunity To Redefine Embedded Computing</h3>\n<p>The company’s solid stance on open software ecosystems resonates in markets that have grown weary of closed, proprietary solutions. This customer-centric approach and a differentiated product roadmap make AMD more than a component supplier: it’s becoming a strategic partner across industries.</p>\n<p>As Intel contends with a <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/intel-vision-2025-a-bold-leap-forward-with-lip-bu-tan-at-the-helm-179681.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new CEO</a>, internal restructuring, and struggles to execute cleanly in the embedded and AI domains, AMD has a rare and meaningful opportunity to gain market share and mindshare.</p>\n<p>Already, the momentum is evident: new design wins, expanding market share in adaptive and embedded CPUs, and deepening traction in custom silicon engagements. The path ahead won’t be without challenges. Arm-based players, vertical integration trends, and software complexity will continue to test all major players, but AMD appears better prepared and positioned than ever.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that AMD is not just catching up; it’s redefining the rules of the embedded game. If it continues to execute with the same precision that defines its turnaround story, AMD won’t just lead in AI at the edge but will help determine what the edge <em>becomes</em>.</p>\n<p>What a remarkable juxtaposition AMD’s position in the semiconductor industry is today compared to just 10 years ago.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>An eleventh-hour move by the Biden Administration to regulate how American AI technology is shared with the world is coming under fire from the nation’s tech sector.</p>\n<p>According to the White House, the Interim Final Rule on Artificial Intelligence Diffusion (IFR) streamlines licensing hurdles for both large and small chip orders, bolsters U.S. AI leadership, and provides clarity to allied and partner nations about how they can benefit from AI. It added that it builds on previous chip controls by thwarting smuggling, closing other loopholes, and raising AI security standards.</p>\n<p>The new rule is necessary, it maintained, “[t]o enhance U.S. national security and economic strength.”</p>\n<p>“[I]t is essential that we do not offshore this critical technology and that the world’s AI runs on American rails,” it asserted. “It is important to work with AI companies and foreign governments to put in place critical security and trust standards as they build out their AI ecosystems.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Kowski, field CTO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a computer and network security company in Pleasanton, Calif., explained that the rule attempts to strike an essential balance between protecting advanced AI capabilities and maintaining technological leadership.</p>\n<p>“Given the increasing sophistication of cyberthreats and potential misuse of AI systems, securing AI infrastructure and computing resources is crucial,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Strong controls on AI chip exports can help prevent advanced capabilities from being used in ways that could compromise security or enable malicious activities.”</p>\n<p>“Fundamentally, economic innovation and national security are intertwined,” added Jeff Le, VP for global government affairs and public policy at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://securityscorecard.com\">SecurityScorecard</a>, a cybersecurity ratings company in New York City.</p>\n<p>“The global competition on sourcing and compute is key for sustained progress in the AI race and pivotal to surpassing China’s ambitions,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There have been linkages with concerns about the Chinese backend and digital vulnerabilities that exist for American data and IP. Reducing the interdependence serves as a vital national security imperative and also allows us to bolster our supply chains, which represent significant vulnerability, as seen by China’s saber-rattling on Taiwan.”</p>\n<h3>Derailing Economic Growth</h3>\n<p>Critics of the rule, which is set to take effect in 120 days, contend it will do more harm than good.</p>\n<p>“Today, companies, startups, and universities around the world are tapping mainstream AI to advance health care, agriculture, manufacturing, education, and countless other fields, driving economic growth and unlocking the potential of nations,” Ned Finkle, VP of government affairs at Nvidia, a major maker of chips used for AI applications, wrote in a company blog.</p>\n<p>“Built on American technology, the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad,” he continued. “That global progress is now in jeopardy. The Biden Administration now seeks to restrict access to mainstream computing applications with its unprecedented and misguided ‘AI Diffusion’ rule, which threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200-plus page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” he contended. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems, and even software are designed and marketed globally.”</p>\n<p>“And by attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition — the lifeblood of innovation — the Biden Administration’s new rule threatens to squander America’s hard-won technological advantage,” he argued.</p>\n<p>“While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,” he added. “The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware. Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead.”</p>\n<h3>Policy Gaps May Undermine US AI Leadership</h3>\n<p>Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C., argued that the IFR raises serious concerns about its potential impact on U.S. competitiveness, global AI leadership, and international alliances.</p>\n<p>“By pressuring other nations to choose between the United States and China, the administration risks alienating key partners and inadvertently strengthening China’s position in the global AI ecosystem,” he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Confronted with such an ultimatum, many countries may opt for the side offering them uninterrupted access to the AI technologies vital for their economic growth and digital futures — and currently, only one country is threatening to cut them off from these technologies.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, Castro added, the IFR’s narrow focus on regulating closed-weight AI models while leaving open-weight equivalents unaddressed creates a glaring and counterproductive imbalance.</p>\n<p>“U.S. companies developing proprietary AI models will face stringent regulatory burdens that foreign competitors can evade by leveraging open-source alternatives,” he explained. “This policy undercuts American firms in the global market and fails to meaningfully mitigate the risks the regulation purports to address.”</p>\n<p>“Instead of bolstering national security or safeguarding U.S. technological leadership, the administration’s approach risks enabling rivals to accelerate their advancements and surpass the United States in this crucial domain,” he contended.</p>\n<p>“The administration’s initial restrictions on chip exports were misguided, and the IFR compounds this misstep,” he added. “Instead of correcting course, the administration persists with counterproductive policies that undermine U.S. leadership in AI while granting rivals a clearer path to dominance. The United States should be working to solidify its position as the global leader in AI by fostering innovation, strengthening alliances, and ensuring the broad availability of U.S. technology to legitimate users worldwide.”</p>\n<p>“A strategy rooted in competitiveness — not containment — will best serve America’s interests in the digital economy of the future,” Castro maintained.</p>\n<h3>Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Losses</h3>\n<p>While agreeing with the underlying objectives of the IFR, University of Pennsylvania Professor of Engineering <a href=\"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benjamin Lee</a> disagrees with the approach taken to pursue those objectives. “Sustaining U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence — both the hardware architectures and the software models — is essential for national security and economic strength,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>However, Lee pointed out that U.S. leadership means that its companies build a hardware and software ecosystem that forms the foundation for global AI computation. “Although administration rulings and export controls produce a narrow, short-term advantage, they may produce a broader, long-term loss to American technological leadership,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“In the short-term, export controls will slow some countries’ deployment of the most advanced GPUs and the largest AI data centers,” he explained. “But in the long-term, export controls will cause other countries to develop their own hardware architectures or software models.”</p>\n<p>“Much of this technology rests on openly published resources or code, lowering barriers to building alternatives to the American technology, if needed,” he continued. “Export controls may also give the United States less visibility into the technological state-of-the-art in other countries.”</p>\n<p>“Ten years ago, similar export controls on Intel CPUs that aimed to slow Chinese growth in high-performance scientific computing led to a burst of computer engineering within China,” he added. “U.S. experts now have less visibility into the state of Chinese supercomputing.”</p>\n<h3>Unintended Consequences of AI Lock-In Policies</h3>\n<p>The IFR is trying to establish “lock-in” at the national level, asserted Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“While lock-in — the practice of forcing customers to use only your technology — can work over a short period, as IBM showcased for several decades, it can also create a trend away from your technology, which is also what happened to IBM and could now happen to the U.S.,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This move, while tactically sound, is strategically suicidal for AI technology in the U.S. long term.”</p>\n<p>“I think the rule was well-meaning but poorly thought through by people who either don’t understand the technology or the market in which the technology operates,” he added. “It will likely hurt U.S. AI interests and safety in the long term in exchange for questionable short-term benefits, making U.S. companies unable to compete with their foreign counterparts during a time when U.S. tech is superior and assure it won’t be that way long-term.”</p>\n<p>“China’s capabilities are increasing faster than the U.S.’s largely due to China’s government taking a far more aggressive stance on assisting with tech advancements,” Enderle said. “If the U.S. doesn’t respond appropriately, the tech market will follow oil, trains, electronics, and automobiles to other countries, most likely China.”</p>\n<p>Kris Bondi, CEO and co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mimoto.ai\">Mimoto</a>, a threat detection and response company in San Francisco, added that one of the most frustrating things about decrees from any administration is that they tend to be all or nothing. “Regulations are needed, but they should be on access, monitoring, and the usage of AI,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“While I agree that the use and protection of AI is critical for U.S. national security and economic strength, this form of isolationism will undermine innovation,” she said. “Not every advancement is produced on U.S. soil. Instead of protecting, the bubble this rule will create will limit the ability of the U.S. to evolve and compete on a global scale.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Fast, secure, reliable connectivity is now an expectation at multifamily residences, according to a report released Monday by market research and consulting company <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.parksassociates.com/\">Parks Associates</a> and Xfinity Communities.</p>\n<p>Residents need access to high-speed internet services to work, attend class, and stream video and games, among other high-bandwidth activities, it explained, while properties need connectivity solutions that help them better manage operations, bring down costs, and reduce risk in an age of skyrocketing insurance costs.</p>\n<p>“By embracing connectivity, IoT, and wireless technologies, property owners can not only improve their operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness but also enhance tenant satisfaction and retention, ultimately leading to increased profitability and long-term asset value,” Jeff Barney, president of <a href=\"https://www.tp-link.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TP-Link Systems</a>, a global provider of networking devices and accessories, headquartered in Irvine, Calif., told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Property owners can generate revenue by providing IoT and property-wide Wi-Fi services to the tenant,” he added.</p>\n<p>Many multifamily properties are looking at different ways to deploy and adopt connectivity technologies, noted Parks analyst Kristen Hanich, but they’re also carefully considering the financial results they can expect by rolling them out.</p>\n<p>“They want to know what the return on investment [ROI] will be on operations,” she told TechNewsWorld, “and if they’re a short-term kind of investment company, how much will be added to a property’s value by rolling out some of these technologies.”</p>\n<h3>Gaining Competitive Edge</h3>\n<p>The multifamily real estate market is embracing connectivity and IoT to enhance tenant experiences and attract tech-savvy renters, explained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“Smart building technologies like automated lighting, temperature control, and security systems improve operational efficiency and lower maintenance costs for property managers,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Additionally, connected devices enable better energy management, reducing utility expenses and promoting sustainability.”</p>\n<p>“As tenants increasingly expect seamless connectivity and smart living solutions, properties offering these amenities gain a competitive edge in the market,” he added.</p>\n<p>Hanich explained that many new properties under construction for the last few years are about to hit the market. “When they do, we expect that a lot of existing properties are going to have to compete more tightly for renters and residents,” she said. “So we expect that a lot of existing properties, older properties, are going to look at what amenities they can offer folks and see what they can do when it comes to some of these connected solutions.”</p>\n<p>However, according to the Parks report, a lack of suitable pre-existing networking infrastructure is a top barrier holding multiple dwelling units (MDUs) back from widely deploying IoT.</p>\n<p>Many existing properties were created without suitable wiring or the infrastructure to run new wiring, it continued. Additionally, many properties do not own the wiring infrastructure, making new connectivity deployments costly or not feasible. As a result, older properties are far less likely to offer smart amenities and have worse experiences with their existing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Parks researchers found that 82% of properties 10 years old or older that offer Wi-Fi have difficulty maintaining device connections on the network compared with just 13% of newer properties.</p>\n<h3>Internet Must Be Available Immediately</h3>\n<p>Poor connections have been a chronic problem due to wireless environments becoming increasingly crowded and wireless devices proliferating, Barney noted, but the introduction of Wi-Fi 7 promises to address those problems with more stable connections.</p>\n<p>In addition, multi-gig Ethernet is becoming available. “With multi-gig Ethernet, more and more bands are becoming available and are being deployed to the properties to help people get connected,” Barney said.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure woes aren’t the only challenges facing tech in the multifamily residential market. “There’s a lack of understanding about what these technologies can and cannot do, and a lack of skills on how to set them up so they perform as intended and provide a better return on investment,” Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore. told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>The Parks report maintained that connectivity services must connect residents to experiences they care about: entertainment, work, safety, and smart living.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it must be ready at move-in, it added. According to Parks’ research, the majority of MDU residents say having internet ready to go immediately after moving in is “very important” in their next home. That ranks third among 16 amenities rated by consumers in the research, just after good insulation, soundproofing, and low-cost internet.</p>\n<p>Parks also noted that more and more MDU residents are using smart home tech acquired themselves and from their properties. It explained that 22% of apartment renters and 58% of condo owners use smart home devices today, and these residents need modern networking services to support them.</p>\n<p>In fact, it added, many properties are offering smart home devices as a differentiator to attract and retain residents — a differentiator that appears to be popular, as 79% of MDU dwellers with property-provided smart home devices and services are satisfied with them.</p>\n<h3>Curbing Insurance Costs</h3>\n<p>Connected technology can impact another concern in the multifamily residence market: insurance. Citing information from TBM Multifamily, an insurance and risk management firm, Parks noted premiums have soared 10% to 40% for multifamily property owners.</p>\n<p>The report explained that properties are seeing the benefits of deploying risk-mitigation technology solutions to reduce the damages caused by catastrophic events such as leaks and floods, which damage multiple units. These solutions are not typically resident-facing but have a strong ROI when implemented on a large scale through reductions in insurance rate increases and preventing small leaks from becoming large incidents.</p>\n<p>There is a growing trend towards insurance discounts for properties with connected solutions, such as water leak detectors. However, Parks acknowledged that this is still at an early stage, and properties may need to negotiate rates or change providers to see the full benefits.</p>\n<p>“Without question, connectivity and IoT in the multifamily market offer significant benefits by enhancing tenant satisfaction, streamlining property management, and improving operational efficiency,” Vena said.</p>\n<p>“These technologies also contribute to sustainability efforts through better energy management and resource optimization. As smart living becomes more prevalent, embracing connectivity and IoT can help properties stay competitive and future-proof their offerings.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Malicious actors on the internet know the meaning of service. In a report released Tuesday on digital threats for the first half of 2024, a global AI cybersecurity company found that many of the prevalent threats deployed during the period heavily used malware-as-a-service (MaaS) tools.</p>\n<p>The report by <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://darktrace.com\">Darktrace</a>, based on analysis of data across the company’s customer deployments, reasoned that the growing popularity of MaaS is due to the lucrative subscription-based income of MaaS ecosystems, as well as the low barrier to entry and high demand.</p>\n<p>By offering pre-packed, plug-and-play malware, the MaaS market has enabled even inexperienced attackers to carry out potentially disruptive attacks regardless of their skill level or technical ability, the report added.</p>\n<p>The report predicted that MaaS will remain a prevalent part of the threat landscape in the foreseeable future. This persistence highlights the adaptive nature of MaaS strains, which can change their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from one campaign to the next and bypass traditional security tools, it noted.</p>\n<p>“The sophistication of malware-as-a-service services is expected to rise due to the demand for more powerful attack tools, posing challenges for cybersecurity professionals and requiring advancements in defense strategies,” said Callie Guenther, a cyber threat research senior manager at <a href=\"https://www.criticalstart.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Critical Start</a>, a national cybersecurity services company.</p>\n<p>“These MaaS offerings will introduce new and adaptive attack vectors, such as advanced phishing schemes and polymorphic malware that continually evolves to evade detection,” she told TechNewsWorld. “The rise of malware-as-a-service represents a transformative challenge in the world of cybersecurity. It has democratized cybercrime and expanded the scope of threats.”</p>\n<h3>Legacy Malware Thriving in Modern Attacks</h3>\n<p>The Darktrace report noted that many MaaS tools, such as Amadey and Raspberry Robin, have used multiple malware families from prior years. This shows that while MaaS strains often adapt their TTPs from one campaign to the next, many strains remain unchanged yet continue to achieve success. It added that some security teams and organizations are still falling short in defending their environments.</p>\n<p>“The continued success of old malware strains indicates that many organizations still have significant vulnerabilities in their security environments,” maintained Frank Downs, senior director of proactive services at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bluevoyant.com\">BlueVoyant</a>, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“This could be due to outdated systems, unpatched software, or a lack of comprehensive security measures,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The persistence of these older threats suggests that some organizations may not be investing adequately in cybersecurity defenses or are failing to follow best practices for system maintenance and updates.”</p>\n<p>Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla., added that most anti-malware detection software is not as good as its vendors claim.</p>\n<p>“Organizations need to know they cannot rely on malware detection as being even close to 100% effective, and they need to respond and defend accordingly,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Anti-malware software alone will not save most organizations. All organizations need multiple defenses across multiple layers to best detect and defend.”</p>\n<h3>Double Dipping Digital Desperadoes</h3>\n<p>Another finding in the report was that “double extortion” was becoming prevalent among ransomware strains. With double extortion, malicious actors will not only encrypt their target’s data but also exfiltrate sensitive files with the threat of publication if the ransom is not paid.</p>\n<p>“Double-extortion started in November 2019 and reached levels over 90% of all ransomware using this strategy within a few years,” Grimes said.</p>\n<p>“It’s popular because even victims with a really good backup aren’t negating the entirety of the risk,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“The percentage of victims paying ransoms has gone down significantly over time, but the ones who are paying are paying far more, many times to protect the stolen confidential data from being released publicly or used against them in a future attack by the same attacker,” he said.</p>\n<p>Matthew Corwin, managing director of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://guidepostsolutions.com\">Guidepost Solutions</a>, a global security, compliance, and investigations firm, added that the threat of double extortion makes the need for a data loss prevention program even more critical for organizations. “DLP implementation for all endpoints and other cloud assets should include data classification, policy enforcement, real-time blocking, quarantining, and alerting,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Attacking the Edge</h3>\n<p>Darktrace also reported that malicious actors continued to execute during the first six months of the year mass-exploitation of vulnerabilities in edge infrastructure devices, such as Ivanti Connect Secure, JetBrains TeamCity, FortiClient Enterprise Management Server, and Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS.</p>\n<p>Initial compromises of these systems can act as a springboard for malicious actors to conduct further activities, such as tooling, network reconnaissance, and lateral movement, the report explained.</p>\n<p>“By compromising edge devices, attackers can gain a strategic foothold in the network, allowing them to monitor and intercept data traffic as it passes through these points,” Downs explained.</p>\n<p>“This means that a carefully exploited edge device can provide attackers with access to a wealth of corporate information, including sensitive data, without the need to compromise multiple internal systems,” he continued. “This not only makes the attack more efficient but also increases the potential impact, as edge devices often handle significant data flows to and from the network.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Morgan Wright, chief security advisor at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com\">SentinelOne</a>, an endpoint protection company in Mountain View, Calif., added, “Many organizations are most likely behind in patching vulnerable devices, like firewalls, VPNs, or email gateways.”</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t help when there are numerous and critical vulnerabilities,” he told TechNewsWorld. “For attackers, it’s the digital equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel.”</p>\n<p>KnowBe’s Grimes agreed that maintenance of edge infrastructure devices is often lax. “Sadly, edge devices have for decades been among the most unpatched devices and software in our environments,” he said. “Most IT shops spend the bulk of their patching effort on servers and workstations. Attackers look at and exploit edge devices because they are less likely to be patched and often contain shared administrative credentials.”</p>\n<h3>DMARC End Run</h3>\n<p>After analyzing 17.8 million emails, the Darktrace researchers also discovered that 62% could bypass DMARC verification checks.</p>\n<p>DMARC is designed to verify that an email message is from the domain it claims it’s from, but it has limitations. Scammers can create domains with names close to a well-known brand and DMARC them. “So as long as they can sneak the fake look-alike domain past victims, their emails will get past DMARC checks,” Grimes explained.</p>\n<p>“The alarming statistics in the latest Darktrace Half-Year Threat Report highlight the need for organizations to adopt a multi-layered approach to email security, incorporating advanced AI-driven anomaly detection and behavioral analysis to complement traditional security measures,” added Stephen Kowski, field CTO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.slashnext.com/\">SlashNext</a>, a computer and network security company, in Pleasanton, Calif.</p>\n<p>“This holistic strategy can help identify and mitigate sophisticated phishing attacks that evade DMARC and other conventional defenses,” he told TechNewsWorld. “By continuously monitoring and adapting to evolving threat patterns, organizations can significantly enhance their email security posture.”</p>\n<p>Dror Liwer, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.coro.net\">Coro</a>, a cloud-based cybersecurity company based in Tel Aviv, Israel, contends that most of the report’s findings point to the same cause. Citing a report released by Coro earlier this year, he noted that 73% of security teams admit to missing or ignoring critical alerts.</p>\n<p>“Too many disparate tools, each needing maintenance, regular updates, and monitoring, lead to security teams dealing with administration instead of protection,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Wright, though, suggested the findings might point to a bigger industry flaw. “With all the money being spent on cybersecurity and the threats that continue to proliferate, it begs the question — are we spending enough money on cybersecurity, or just spending it in the wrong places?” he asked.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Nvidia has faced scrutiny this month because some servers with a whopping 72 Blackwell processors were overheating. The issue arose because some initial OEM deployments were not properly water-cooled, which Lenovo aggressively identified and mitigated with its Neptune warm water-cooling solutions.</p>\n<p>As AI advances, we’ll need more highly dense, incredibly powerful AI processors, which suggests that air cooling in server rooms may become obsolete.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about Blackwell, water cooling, and why Lenovo’s Neptune solution stands out at the moment. We’ll close with my Product of the Week: Microsoft’s Windows 365 Link, which could be the missing link between PCs and terminals that could forever change desktop computing.</p>\n<h3>Blackwell</h3>\n<p>Blackwell is Nvidia’s premier, AI-focused GPU. When it was announced, it was so far over what most would have thought practical that it almost seemed more like a pipe dream than a solution. But it works, and there is nothing close to its class right now. However, it is massively dense in terms of technology and generates a lot of heat.</p>\n<p>Some argue it is a potential ecological disaster. Don’t get me wrong, it does pull a lot of power and generate a tremendous amount of heat. But its performance is so high compared to the kind of load that you’d typically get with more conventional parts that it is relatively economical to run.</p>\n<p>It’s like comparing a semi-truck with three trailers to a U-Haul van. Yes, the semi will get comparatively crappy gas mileage, but it will also hold more cargo than 10 U-Haul vans and use a lot less gas than those 10 vans, making it more ecologically friendly. The same is true of Blackwell. It is so far beyond its competition in terms of performance that its relatively high energy use is below what otherwise would be required for a competitive AI server.</p>\n<p>But Blackwell chips do run hot, and most servers today are air-cooled. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that some Blackwell servers were configured with air cooling and those with 72 or more Blackwell processors on a rack overheated. While 72 Blackwells in a rack is unusual today, as AI advances, it will become more common, given Nvidia is currently the king of AI.</p>\n<p>You can only go so far with air-cooled technology in terms of performance before you have to move to liquid cooling. While Nvidia did respond to this issue with a water-cooled rack specification that <a href=\"https://x.com/MichaelDell/status/1858306164775379268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell is now using</a>, Lenovo was way ahead of the curve with its Neptune water-cooling solution.</p>\n<h3>Lenovo Neptune</h3>\n<p>Lenovo was the first to realize this, mainly because it is currently the market leader in its class in terms of water cooling — a technology initially acquired from IBM, which has been doing water cooling for decades.</p>\n<p>What is important with water cooling isn’t just the technology but the knowledge of how to deploy it safely. Mixing water and high-amperage electronics can be a disaster if you don’t know what you’re doing. As a result of the IBM server acquisition, Lenovo has decades of water cooling experience that it calls <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/servers-storage/neptune/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neptune</a>.</p>\n<p>Given Nvidia has specified a water-cooled rack, what makes Neptune better? The answer is experience. Most that will use the Nvidia-specified solution, including Nvidia, don’t often deploy water-cooled solutions. As a result, particularly with these high-end Blackwell implementations, they’ll essentially be learning on the job.</p>\n<p>It can be really dangerous when you mix water with high-amperage electronics. Water and electricity don’t mix. Not only can a leak fry an expensive part or even an entire rack, but if a person is present, it can fry them, too, if the breakers don’t set in. In a raised-floor environment, unless it has been designed with leaks in mind, terrible things can happen.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>I observed this myself decades ago when I was at IBM, and it turned out they hadn’t stress-tested the water-cooling system for our massive (for the time) data center. The site lost a transformer that shut off the water-cooling system, which hadn’t been stress-tested for a sudden stop. The pipes burst, and the data center became a dangerous swimming pool. Most of the hardware, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, was lost, and the building was flooded, doing additional damage.</p>\n<p>Through experiences like this, IBM became the leading OEM for safe water cooling, and Lenovo acquired that knowledge and experience when it bought the IBM x86 server group. Now, Lenovo, along with IBM, knows how to do water cooling better than most, which means that you can rest assured that a Lenovo Blackwell server won’t overheat or suddenly begin to leak.</p>\n<p>Plus, Lenovo’s expertise is in warm water cooling, a far safer and far less expensive way to cool servers than cold water cooling, which requires huge, inefficient evaporators or chillers.</p>\n<p>Implementing this technology is no trivial task. Unlike automobiles or PCs that are water-cooled, servers have to have hot swapping capabilities, which means you need exceptional and highly tested drip-free connections, aggressive alerting, preventive maintenance schedules based on past knowledge of components, and technicians experienced with working with this level of water-cooling tech.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: A Future of Warm-Water-Cooled Data Centers</h3>\n<p>Blackwell is only the first of these incredibly powerful processors to hit the market because as AI pushes the envelope, Nvidia’s competitors will also have to push into something similar, suggesting all servers may eventually need to be warm water cooled.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> That positions Lenovo nicely for a water-cooled future regardless of the technology while Lenovo’s competitors try to catch up. One benefit I expect techs to look forward to is the reduction in data center noise. The amount of air you have to push through air-cooled servers is massive and turns today’s data centers into a noise nightmare.</p>\n<p>As warm-water cooling moves into the market more aggressively, these data centers will quiet down, making them far more pleasant places to work. That will make many of us who have to work in them very happy.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Windows 365 Link</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Windows-365-Link.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft's Windows 365 Link Cloud PC device front, side and back views \" width=\"1000\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Windows-365-Link.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Windows-365-Link-300x96.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Windows-365-Link-768x246.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: Microsoft</p>\n<p>Ever since we replaced terminals with PCs, IT has wanted the terminal experience back. Terminals were like pre-smart TVs in that you didn’t have to do patches or OS upgrades or deal with the “blue screen of death.” If the thing broke, it was pretty easy to fix or was relatively inexpensive to replace. From an IT perspective, terminals were a ton better than PCs.</p>\n<p>But on the PC side, terminals sucked. You couldn’t run what you wanted to run without getting IT support, and it could take months for IT to respond to a request.</p>\n<p>Terminals were connected to aging mainframes that couldn’t run modern applications at the time (they can now). New applications were usually custom-built, but a gap in communication between users and IT frequently led to problems. Users struggled to articulate their needs, and IT often failed to probe for better specifications, resulting in frequently unusable applications.</p>\n<p>Well, at Microsoft Ignite last week, Microsoft announced the <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-365-link—the-first-cloud-pc-device-for-windows-365/4302687\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows 365 Link</a>, which may be the closest thing to a perfect wired (there’s no laptop solution yet) terminal with PC-like features and performance.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introducing Windows 365 Link: Satya Nadella at Microsoft Ignite 2024\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQpNTDgzIn8\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>While we call the class a thin client, Microsoft calls this a Cloud PC. At $349 and the size of a micro-PC, it appears to have the closest we’ve seen in terms of a near-perfect PC/terminal blend.</p>\n<p>Windows 365 Link will be more reliable, cheaper, secure, and far smaller than most desktop PCs, making it very attractive for IT. At the same time, it connects to a Cloud PC instance, providing the user with a very PC-like experience.</p>\n<p>It only targets enterprise accounts right now, mainly because they have the greatest need and the necessary infrastructure. I see this moving to markets like travel, education, government, manufacturing, and other vertical markets with similar needs. Although it doesn’t yet address mobile users, fully deployed 5G and the coming 6G specification should allow future mobile implementations.</p>\n<p>Given Microsoft was one of the companies that launched the PC and made terminals obsolete, it seems ironic — and poetic — that Microsoft takes the lead in making them obsolete, eventually. We’ll see if that happens. For now, the Windows 365 Link is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://canonical.com/\">Canonical</a> released Ubuntu 24.10 “Oracular Oriole” on Oct. 10, 2024. This latest version brings performance improvements and enhanced hardware support while also marking a special milestone — 20 years since Ubuntu’s first stable release.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) is still being supported and will continue to receive five years of free security maintenance updates.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to upgrade your existing Ubuntu 24.04 installation to the latest Ubuntu 24.10.</p>\n<h3>Why Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10?</h3>\n<p>As Ubuntu 24.04 is an LTS release, there’s no requirement to upgrade since it will be supported for at least five years. You can extend this for another five years through an Ubuntu Pro subscription, which is free for personal devices. Paid subscribers who install the Legacy Support add-on can benefit from an additional two years of coverage.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu 24.10 will receive security and maintenance for just nine months out of the box. However, it is also compatible with Ubuntu Pro and comes with several upgrades.</p>\n<p>For instance, Ubuntu now ships with the latest available version of the upstream Linux kernel. The kernel version is determined by Ubuntu’s freeze date, even if the kernel is still in Release Candidate (RC) status. This approach allows users to benefit from the latest features, though it may come at the possible expense of system stability.</p>\n<p>The main flavor of Ubuntu 24.10 also ships with the latest Gnome 47 desktop, an upgraded App Center, an experimental Security Center, and better management of Snap packages.</p>\n<p>See the official <a href=\"https://canonical.com/blog/canonical-releases-ubuntu-24-10-oracular-oriole\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oracular Oriole announcement</a> to discover all the latest features in Ubuntu.</p>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<p>Ubuntu 22.04 supports upgrading via the command line or the built-in software updater.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to upgrade is to launch the software updater to ensure you have the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 (currently 22.04.01). Then, you can modify the updater settings to allow you to upgrade to a regular non-LTS release of Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>Rerunning the software updater will display the option to upgrade your OS.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step1.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"566\"></p>\n<p>If you choose to proceed, the Ubuntu upgrade tool will connect to the relevant software channels and download the necessary packages.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu disables third-party repositories and PPAs by default during upgrade. However, once the OS is upgraded to version 24.10, you can re-enable these via the command line.</p>\n<h4>Step 1. Prepare your System</h4>\n<p>Upgrading Ubuntu is a relatively simple process. Still, whenever making any significant changes to your OS, it’s best to take some steps to keep your data safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save and close any open files. Do the same for any active programs.</li>\n<li>If using a portable device, connect to AC power so the battery won’t fail as you update the OS.</li>\n<li>Ensure all your files are backed up using your chosen <a href=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/story/essential-tips-for-reliable-linux-backups-177398.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">utility</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Next, check that your installation of Ubuntu 24.04 is fully up to date. The easiest way to do this is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the Activities launcher and enter “software” into the search bar.</li>\n<li>Choose the Software Updater icon to check for updates automatically.</li>\n<li>If any updates are available, choose “Install Now” to continue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your computer may need to restart to finish installing updates. If so, select “Restart Now” from the Software Updater menu to continue.</p>\n<p>You can also update Ubuntu 24.04 via the command line. Open Terminal, then run:</p>\n<p>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade</p>\n<p>Press “Y” to confirm you wish to update the OS to the most recent version.</p>\n<h4>Step 2. Get Ready To Upgrade</h4>\n<p>Once the system reboots, repeat the instructions outlined in the previous step to launch the Software Updater.</p>\n<p>If further updates are available, download and apply them now before continuing. Once these have all been applied, you’ll see a Software Updater notification saying your system is up to date.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step2.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>Choose “Settings” to launch “Software &amp; Updates.” From here, select the “Updates” tab. In the dropdown menu labeled “Notify me of a new Ubuntu version,” choose “For any new version.” This means Ubuntu 24.10 will appear as an upgrade option, even though it’s not a Long-Term Support release.</p>\n<p>Choose “Close,” then relaunch the Software Updater. You’ll now see a notification saying that Ubuntu 22.04 is up to date, but Ubuntu 24.10 is available. Choose “Upgrade” to continue.</p>\n<p>If this notification doesn’t appear, you can also manually check for the latest version of Ubuntu via Terminal. Open the utility and run:</p>\n<p>sudo update-manager -c</p>\n<h4>Step 3. Start the Upgrade</h4>\n<p>Once the Ubuntu upgrade utility launches, it will display a brief overview of everything new in Oracular Oriole. There’s also a link to the official release notes if you need a detailed breakdown.</p>\n<p>After reading through these, click “Start Upgrade” to continue. This will download the latest release upgrade tool.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step3.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\"></p>\n<p>Next, the “Distribution Upgrade” will launch. You’ll notice a tilde next to “Preparing to Upgrade.” The tool will then update the OS software channels.</p>\n<p>Once this is done, you’ll see a new window asking, “Do you want to start the upgrade?” Click “Details” for more information about the packages that will be changed/removed. Choose “Start Upgrade” to continue.</p>\n<p>During the upgrade process, the system notified us several times that Oracular was not responding. We chose “Wait” in each case, and the upgrade continued without issue.</p>\n<h4>Step 4. Install Your Upgrades</h4>\n<p>Once you start the upgrade, Ubuntu will inform you that the lock screen will be disabled during the process. Select “Close” to continue.</p>\n<p>The upgrade tool will then begin downloading and installing the necessary packages. During this stage, the desktop wallpaper will change to the default background for Oracular Oriole.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step4.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"566\"></p>\n<p>You may also see a prompt regarding “libc6” during the upgrade, asking whether Ubuntu should restart services during package upgrades without asking. Click “Next” to confirm.</p>\n<p>If you want more detailed information on the installation process, choose “Terminal.”</p>\n<h4>Step 5. Cleaning Up</h4>\n<p>Once the installation stage is complete, the release upgrade tool will start cleaning up. A window asks if you wish to “Remove obsolete packages.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step5.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 5, cleaning up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"554\"></p>\n<p>Click on “Details” to view more information about these, then choose “Keep” or “Remove” as you see fit. If you’re uncertain, it’s usually best to remove these as they take up space on your hard drive.</p>\n<h4>Step 6. Confirm Your Upgrade</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve dealt with the obsolete packages, Ubuntu will prompt you to restart the system to complete the upgrade.</p>\n<p>After logging in to the Ubuntu desktop, you can verify that the upgrade has worked by opening “Activities” and launching “About” from System Settings. From here, you can view key information, including the operating system, which should now display Ubuntu 24.10.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step6.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 6\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\"></p>\n<p>If you prefer using the CLI to check your OS version, open Terminal and run:</p>\n<p>lsb_release -a</p>\n<p>The OS “Release” should read 24.10 if the upgrade has worked successfully.</p>\n<h4>Step 7. Re-Enable PPAs and Repos</h4>\n<p>By default, whenever the Ubuntu OS is upgraded, any third-party repositories and/or PPAs are disabled. This ensures a smoother upgrade but also makes it difficult to update certain third-party software.</p>\n<p>Luckily, you can easily enable the repos and PPAs again. To get started, open Terminal and run:</p>\n<p>sudo nano etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources</p>\n<p>This file lists all available software sources.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/step7.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial, step 7,  Re-Enable PPAs and Repos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"575\"></p>\n<p>If you see any third-party repos listed, use the arrow keys to scroll down and remove ‘#’ at the beginning of the line. You can now save and exit the file using Ctrl + X, then Y.</p>\n<p>These changes should take effect next time you run a system update.</p>\n<h3>Stay Updated</h3>\n<p>Even if you didn’t need to enable any third-party repos or PPAs in the previous step, keeping your system up to date is always a good idea.</p>\n<p>You can do this in Ubuntu 24.10 the same way as Ubuntu 22.04. As outlined in Step 1, simply open “Activities” and enter “software” to launch Software Updater.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu 24.10 also supports updates via Terminal via the latest version of APT (3.0). To update this way, enter:</p>\n<p>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</p>\n<p>We recommend using the Terminal for this first update as if any third-party repos/PPAs are disabled, you’ll see an alert.</p>\n<h3>Upgrading via the Command Line</h3>\n<p>Experienced Linux users may want to upgrade Ubuntu via the command line. This can be much faster as there are no graphical windows to navigate.</p>\n<p>To get started, you need to configure Ubuntu 22.04 to allow upgrades to non-LTS versions of the OS.</p>\n<p>Open Terminal and run:</p>\n<p>sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linuxinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/terminal-upgrade.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10 tutorial: using terminal commands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\"></p>\n<p>From here, change <em>Prompt=LTS</em> to <em>Prompt=normal</em>. Press Ctrl + x, then y to save and exit.</p>\n<p>Next, ensure that Ubuntu 22.04 is fully up to date by running:</p>\n<p>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</p>\n<p>You can now launch the upgrade tool via the command line with:</p>\n<p>sudo do-release-upgrade</p>\n<p>Press ‘y’, then follow the on-screen prompts to complete the upgrade. You can also enter ‘y’ to confirm the removal of obsolete packages.</p>\n<p>We hope you found this step-by-step upgrade guide for Ubuntu 24.10 helpful, allowing you to benefit from the latest features and superior performance with the latest version of the OS.</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The Ubuntu images and screenshots featured in this article are credited to Canonical.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Until now, I haven’t been a fan of billionaire businessperson Mark Cuban. I put him in the same group as many billionaires who prioritize getting even wealthier over everything, including their families. However, based on what I saw last week, I couldn’t have been more wrong about Mark Cuban.</p>\n<p>Jon Stewart, who often does a better job of interviewing than most journalists, had Cuban as a guest on “The Daily Show.” One thing Cuban mentioned was that he wasn’t chasing the next big power trip but was focused instead on getting to know his kids and grandkids better. I wish more of the folks in his wealth class would come to this determination as it would benefit not only their families but the world.</p>\n<p>While Cuban and Stewart started on politics, they moved on to AI. I follow AI closely, and what they said about it was dead-on correct: We need to achieve a balance between pursuing this technology responsibly and assuring that our foes will not better develop it and put the entire human race at risk.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about AI, then close with my Product of the Week: Mark Cuban’s medicine supply company that operates under the concept of “open and transparent,” an idea that has caught fire in tech but stands against people being charged unreasonable prices for their medicines.</p>\n<p>Cuban’s firm, Cost Plus Drugs, is fully transparent and can sell drugs profitably for tens of dollars that other companies charge thousands for. An example given was a drug typically costing $30,000 per month that Cost Plus Drugs sells for $64.</p>\n<h3>Gen Z and AI</h3>\n<p>Like me, Stewart and Cuban are baby boomers. Also, like me, it is clear to them that most boomers will not only be unable to use AI effectively but also don’t understand it well enough to protect us from its misuse.</p>\n<p>Mark argued that Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, would likely be the first generation to fully accept AI for its potential and be best able to develop effective guardrails around its use. The youngest of that group is only 12 years old now, while the oldest is 27 and just starting their careers.</p>\n<p>Granted, subsequent generations will also have this ability, but they are, as yet, too young to have an impact before the dangers of AI are likely to overwhelm us. So, Generation Z should have the understanding, ability, and timing to ensure that AI helps the human race and doesn’t destroy it.</p>\n<p>I wish them the best of luck because this will be anything but easy. It was a tad depressing that he pointed out that our age group went from “sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll to Fox News,” which isn’t something I want to be remembered for, but that is, sadly, kind of accurate.</p>\n<h3>We Can’t Just Shut Down AI</h3>\n<p>There was a huge push by some tech leaders to “pause” AI development. I thought this effort was stupid because when you have a technology that has the potential to redefine the world and the nature of work globally, let alone redefine weapons by making them more deadly, there is no power on earth that would be strong enough to stop its development.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>If you pause AI development domestically, it will simply mean the next war you enter will be your last, given that you wouldn’t survive it. Similar to nuclear weapons, you might get promises to stop development, but in reality, it would continue underground, and you’d never truly stop it.</p>\n<p>Cuban was on message here, indicating it was critical for the nation that we aggressively develop AI, but also indicating that rather than stopping it, the effort should be on assuring the responsible development and use of the technology — something that, again, boomers aren’t up to doing.</p>\n<h3>We Don’t Know Where AI Is Going</h3>\n<p>Cuban was also correct in noting that we have no clear idea where generative AI is headed because it’s still so new. With the arrival of artificial general intelligence (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AGI</a>), which could be far more powerful and cheaper to develop, this uncertainty is particularly dangerous. That’s why it’s crucial to have some form of monitoring and appropriate safeguards in place.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the U.S. dominates this technology for now, which is vital to defense and business. Cuban feels that it is a positive right now, which I agree with, but it can be extremely dangerous.</p>\n<p>Stewart pointed out that this technology could damage labor pools, jobs, and even companies.</p>\n<p>Cuban reiterated that the right folks to set up these guardrails are those who grew up with this technology and should better understand how to regulate the dangers while not limiting innovation. If this is done incorrectly, we may face a problem we can’t mitigate, or another country may develop one that we can’t counter.</p>\n<p>Cuban praised the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chips and Science Act</a> as a great first step but not a final step because it’s focused mainly on assuring the U.S. could maintain manufacturing critical mass should a conflict result. Still, it doesn’t yet address the guardrail problem. He implied that the current congress is under-skilled in taking the threat as seriously as it should be or understanding how to create a balanced approach so that the remedy isn’t worse than the problem.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>If you get a chance to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayhRmnFlSkE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watch the video</a> of Stewart’s conversation with Cuban, be aware it starts with some political opinion. The AI discussion begins about halfway through the interview.</p>\n<p>From this easy-to-understand commentary, you’ll learn a bit about where we are with AI and where we need to be. It balances the promise with the risk of AI and makes a decent case that we should manage AI in a way that doesn’t slow innovation except where it might create unacceptable risks.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>It also raises the specter of what might happen if a hostile foreign government develops this technology to do harm and loses control of it. One thing neither Stewart nor Cuban fully addressed was the concept of an <a href=\"https://lifeboat.com/ex/aishield\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Shield</a> and the critical nature of having it in place before some foreign or illegal domestic entity creates something that none of our existing defensive technologies can defend against.</p>\n<p>Jon Stewart and Mark Cuban reinforced my belief that we are far from ready for the coming AI wave. While it may be mostly beneficial at first, we lack sufficient safeguards to ensure it stays that way. I wish I had better news.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Cost Plus Drugs</h3>\n<p>I don’t know about you, but every time I read a story about the price of medicines worldwide, I get pissed. Much of the development occurs in the U.S., where we also pay the highest prices for the result, even though our taxes often subsidize the development of the related unaffordable drug.</p>\n<p>People shouldn’t have to decide between medication, food, or shelter. The cost of some medicines is just nuts. Cuban and his team at <a href=\"https://costplusdrugs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cost Plus Drugs</a> made his pricing open so you can see what they paid for the drug, the markup (15%), the expert charge (generally nominal), and any additional costs behind the price.</p>\n<p>Examples from the Cost Plus Drugs website include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Imatinib:</strong> Retail Price $2,502.50 | $13.40 at Cost Plus Drugs</li>\n<li><strong>Abiraterone Acetate:</strong> Retail Price $1,093.20 | $26.90 at Cost Plus Drugs</li>\n<li><strong>Mesalamine:</strong> Retail Price $766.80 | $28.70 at Cost Plus Drugs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be aware that these are generic alternatives for Gleevec, Zytiga, and Canasa.

      "content": "<p>As the world increasingly relies on artificial intelligence, the demand for efficient and scalable data centers has never been higher. AI applications require vast amounts of computational power, driving up energy consumption and raising concerns about the environmental impact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infineon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infineon Technologies</a>, a leader in power management solutions, has emerged as a key player in addressing these challenges by collaborating with companies like <a href=\"https://store.supermicro.com/us_en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supermicro</a> to enhance the energy efficiency of data centers.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine how the growing demand for AI in enterprise and consumer markets impacts power consumption in data centers — and how Infineon’s partnership with Supermicro addresses these challenges.</p>\n<h3>Energy Demands in AI Data Centers</h3>\n<p>The explosive growth of AI-driven data centers is accompanied by skyrocketing energy requirements. The scale of this trend is nothing short of startling.</p>\n<p>Data centers in 2010 accounted for about 2% to 3% of global energy consumption. Today, some estimates predict that data centers, including those driven by AI, could consume as much as 7% of the world’s energy by 2030, with some regions seeing much higher rates.</p>\n<p>For instance, Ireland, a significant hub for data centers, could see as much as 32% of its energy devoted to these facilities by 2026.</p>\n<p>The sheer volume of compute power needed to train modern AI models is growing at a rate that doubles every three to four months.</p>\n<p>As a result, data centers require cutting-edge power solutions that can keep up with both the increased energy demand and the need for enhanced cooling systems to prevent overheating.</p>\n<h3>Infineon’s Semiconductor Solutions</h3>\n<p>Adam White, division president of Infineon’s Power and Sensor Systems Group, believes the key to addressing AI acceleration is the need for innovation in semiconductor technology.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a>, White stated that Infineon has stayed at the forefront of developing the hardware required to support the energy-hungry data centers of the future. The company focuses on providing power solutions from the “grid to the core,” meaning it is involved in each step of the power supply chain within a data center — from renewable energy inputs to power management within AI servers.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>A critical component of Infineon’s strategy is silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) materials. These wide-bandgap semiconductors offer superior power efficiency and density, making them ideal for AI data centers that must pack more compute power into increasingly smaller spaces.</p>\n<p>White explained that Infineon has been increasing its investments in these materials to meet the demand for more efficient and powerful semiconductor solutions. The company is also working on vertical power delivery methods that could be embedded closer to the processor, further reducing power losses and improving overall efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Supermicro and Green Computing</h3>\n<p>Infineon’s partnership with Supermicro demonstrates how these technological innovations are being implemented. Supermicro, a provider of green computing solutions, is leveraging Infineon’s high-efficiency power stages (TDA21490 and TDA21535) to reduce the energy consumption of its MicroBlade servers significantly.</p>\n<p>These servers are designed to address the growing power needs of AI-driven data centers while minimizing the environmental impact.</p>\n<p>The collaboration focuses on improving power usage effectiveness (PUE), a metric used to measure data center efficiency. By reducing the energy wasted in cooling and other non-computational processes, Supermicro and Infineon have worked together to create more sustainable data centers that can meet the increasing demands of AI applications without drastically increasing their carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant advancements from this partnership is the ability to offer solutions that reduce power wastage while maintaining or improving performance. Adopting these high-efficiency power stages allows data centers to increase their compute density without requiring proportionally higher energy inputs, making it possible to handle more AI workloads with less power.</p>\n<h3>Cooling and Thermal Management</h3>\n<p>Another challenge that White highlighted during our conversation is the issue of cooling. As data centers grow in power density, managing heat becomes increasingly tricky. Approximately 50% of the energy consumed by a data center can be lost to cooling, representing a significant inefficiency.</p>\n<p>While traditional air-cooling methods are still in use, many companies are now exploring advanced solutions like liquid and immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in liquid to manage heat more efficiently.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>White also mentioned the exploration of more exotic cooling solutions, such as underwater data centers. While these may sound like science fiction, they are being actively researched and could become a reality in the near future.</p>\n<p>These solutions are critical for maintaining the reliability and longevity of AI data centers, as overheating can lead to hardware failure and costly downtime, especially during the intensive training of large AI models.</p>\n<h3>Flexible Power Solutions for AI Hardware Platforms</h3>\n<p>Infineon’s appeal in the AI-driven data center space can be attributed to its agnostic approach to semiconductor design. White explained that the company tailors its power management solutions to meet each customer’s unique needs, whether using Nvidia GPUs, Intel processors, or other specialized AI hardware. This flexibility allows Infineon to work with a wide range of partners and adapt its solutions to different architectures and power requirements.</p>\n<p>This approach is essential in a rapidly evolving market where the landscape of AI hardware is constantly shifting. While Nvidia currently dominates the market for AI GPUs, other companies, like Intel and AMD, are also making significant strides in this space.</p>\n<p>Infineon’s ability to offer power solutions that work across different platforms positions the company as a critical player in the future of AI data centers.</p>\n<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>\n<p>The future of AI-driven data centers presents immense opportunities and significant challenges, particularly when managing energy consumption and cooling.</p>\n<p>Companies like Infineon Technologies play a crucial role in ensuring these data centers can operate efficiently and sustainably as AI applications grow in complexity and power requirements.</p>\n<p>Through collaborations with firms like Supermicro and continuing innovations in semiconductor technology, Infineon is well-positioned to meet the needs of the next generation of AI data centers, paving the way for a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly future.</p>\n<p>This ongoing evolution highlights the importance of partnerships and technological advancements in making AI more efficient and sustainable. As the demand for compute power continues to surge to&nbsp;unprecedented levels due to AI, Infineon’s role in developing energy-efficient solutions will be vital in shaping tomorrow’s data center.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A new privacy report ranking the top 15 social media platforms found Reddit and Snapchat as the least intrusive on their users’ privacy. At the other end of the spectrum were Meta products Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.</p>\n<p>The ranking performed by data removal service <a href=\"https://blog.incogni.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Incogni</a> was based on 14 criteria across five key categories: transgressions, data collection and retention, user control and consent, transparency, and user-friendliness.</p>\n<p>“Our researchers have created a comprehensive privacy ranking that reveals significant variations in the data-protection practices of these platforms,” the company wrote in its ranking report.</p>\n<p>The three platforms with the best privacy scores were Reddit, with an 8.9 score, Snapchat (9.99), and Pinterest (10.49).</p>\n<p>“Reddit and Snapchat allow for greater user anonymity and minimize long-term data exposure,” explained <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/subrosajohn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Price</a>, founder and CEO of SubRosa, a cybersecurity services provider.</p>\n<p>“For example,” he continued, “Reddit lets users engage without revealing personal information, while Snapchat’s disappearing messages reduce the risk of data being retained.”</p>\n<p>“These platforms also tend to collect less personal information compared to data-driven networks,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Reddit allows anonymous accounts, and they don’t require a lot of personal information for sign-up,” added <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shailarana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shaila Rana</a>, a professor at Purdue Global, an online public university.</p>\n<p>“Reddit is more focused on communities than building a personal profile,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>She also pointed out that Snapchat not only has disappearing messages but also notifies users if someone takes a screenshot of their content and doesn’t have public news feeds like Facebook or LinkedIn. “That’s what lowers its privacy risks,” she said. “It has more private usage.”</p>\n<h3>User as Product</h3>\n<p>Mike Machado, CISO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.beyondtrust.com/\">BeyondTrust</a>, a maker of privileged account management and vulnerability management solutions in Carlsbad, Calif., asserted that the word “invasive” is key to Incogni’s report. “The less invasive platforms are, the less interested they are at trying to monetize the user as their product,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The worst offenders are like thinly disguised pleasure island traps, to use a Pinocchio analogy,” he said. “What appears to be the product is just a lure to get you to provide information about yourself and use the platform in ways that generate more information about yourself, with the end goal being for that business to monetize you and information about you as their real revenue stream.”</p>\n<p>“From their data practices,” he continued, “one might surmise that a business like Reddit is more interested in their customer being the person who is communicating on the platform and less interested in their customer being their advertisers.”</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the rankings were Facebook with a score of 18.98, Facebook Messenger (16.51) and Instagram (15.84). Business and professional networking platform LinkedIn finished in the middle of the pack with a score of 13.35.</p>\n<div data-id=\"becf632e-8e65-4fb6-925f-f845342b075f\" data-type=\"interactive\" data-title=\"Social media privacy ranking 2024\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>“Facebook, Messenger, and LinkedIn collect extensive personal information, including real names, contact info, and employment history,” SubRosa’s Price explained. “Facebook’s business model relies on data for targeted advertising, while LinkedIn’s detailed profiles are attractive targets for phishing attacks. This extensive data collection significantly increases user privacy risks.”</p>\n<p>BeyondTrust’s Machado added that those risks are increased at the user’s expense, not for any benefit. “The data is put to good use to benefit their revenue-generating advertising customers, but does that benefit the user in any meaningful way?”</p>\n<p>In their report, the researchers noted that data collection and retention vary considerably across platforms and contribute significantly to their rankings. This category played a significant role in the poor scores of Meta’s products — with the exception of WhatsApp — and saw Telegram come out on top, they explained.</p>\n<p>They noted that Instagram and Facebook were found to have the most problematic data collection and retention practices, while Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, YouTube, and Discord kept users’ data the longest after a successful account deletion request.</p>\n<div data-id=\"46729ddc-3164-4ad9-9f8c-313c5a3089dd\" data-type=\"interactive\" data-title=\"Data collection and retention\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Out of Control User Controls</h3>\n<p>Purdue Global’s Rana added that not only do Facebook and LinkedIn collect a lot of data about their users, but they also make it difficult for users to protect their data from the grasping hands of the platforms. “Facebook is not very user-friendly in terms of their privacy settings,” she said.</p>\n<p>“LinkedIn has really complex privacy settings that can be difficult for many people to navigate, especially if you look at the wide range of users that are on that platform, ranging from technical to non-technical,” she continued. “It can be really complex to understand what those privacy settings are.”</p>\n<p>She also noted that LinkedIn shares data with third-party recruiters and companies and collects lots of professional and personal information. “That makes it more prone to having higher privacy risks,” she observed.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The Incogni researchers also found that user control and consent were inconsistent in how much effect it had on the investigated platforms’ overall scores. That category contains criteria like what privacy settings are available, what the default settings are, what can be opted out of, and the public display of users’ personal information with the strictest visibility options set.</p>\n<p>The report noted that Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp (both Meta platforms) performed the worst in this category, while Pinterest, Reddit, and Twitch did the best.</p>\n<p>It also found that LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter) publicly display the most user data with the strictest “visibility” settings selected and that Facebook had the highest number of GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulatory violations, while LinkedIn suffered the greatest number of data breaches.</p>\n<div data-id=\"b7cd57d1-84fd-495d-b691-3ba68ecc4648\" data-type=\"interactive\" data-title=\"Data breaches experienced by the platforms\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Can Privacy Be Protected?</h3>\n<p>For users concerned about their privacy on social media platforms, Megan Celestini, founder of Queen Bee Social, a social media marketing company in Cape Coral, Fla., offers this advice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before signing up for a platform, read how they will use your information and photos. It’s important to know what you are agreeing to.</li>\n<li>Be cautious of what you post. So many people give away very sensitive information. One example I often see is children sharing adorable back-to-school photos in front of your house with their school and teacher’s names on their celebration board. I and strangers now know your address, where your child goes to school, who their teacher is, and sometimes who their best friends are.</li>\n<li>Set your profile to private. This approach can help to mitigate things as far as Meta using your information from Facebook and Instagram to train its artificial intelligence models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, some people believe preserving privacy may be a lost cause. “At this point, whatever information these platforms want to get, they will get,” declared Gary Flayter, celebrity brand and social media director at <a href=\"https://kronuscommunications.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kronus Communications</a>, a public relations firm in Salt Lake City.</p>\n<p>“You use your face to unlock your phone. If you have a new MacBook laptop, you use your fingerprint to log in,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Your information is out there, either through social media or a smartphone.”</p>\n<p>“If you’re really that worried about privacy,” he said, “delete all your social media accounts and use a flip phone.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Governments seek to create security safeguards around artificial intelligence, but roadblocks and indecision are delaying cross-nation agreements on priorities and obstacles to avoid.</p>\n<p>In November 2023, Great Britain published its Bletchley Declaration, agreeing to boost global efforts to cooperate on artificial intelligence safety with 28 countries, including the United States, China, and the European Union.</p>\n<p>Efforts continued to pursue AI safety regulations in May with the second Global AI Summit, during which the U.K. and the Republic of Korea secured a commitment from 16 global AI tech companies to a set of safety outcomes building on that agreement.</p>\n<p>“The Declaration fulfills key summit objectives by establishing shared agreement and responsibility on the risks, opportunities, and a forward process for international collaboration on frontier AI safety and research, particularly through greater scientific collaboration,” Britain said in a separate statement accompanying the declaration.</p>\n<p>The European Union’s <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Act</a>, adopted in May, became the world’s first major law regulating AI. It includes enforcement powers and penalties, such as fines of $38 million or 7% of their annual global revenues if companies breach the Act.</p>\n<p>Following that, in a Johnny-come-lately response, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators recommended that Congress draft $32 billion in emergency spending legislation for AI and published a report saying the U.S. needs to harness AI opportunities and address the risks.</p>\n<p>“Governments absolutely need to be involved in AI, particularly when it comes to issues of national security. We need to harness the opportunities of AI but also be wary of the risks. The only way for governments to do that is to be informed, and being informed requires a lot of time and money,” Joseph Thacker, principal AI engineer and security researcher at SaaS security company <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://appomni.com/\">AppOmni</a>, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>AI Safety Essential for SaaS Platforms</h3>\n<p>AI safety is growing in importance daily. Nearly every software product, including AI applications, is now built as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application, noted Thacker. As a result, ensuring the security and integrity of these SaaS platforms will be critical.</p>\n<p>“We need robust security measures for SaaS applications. Investing in SaaS security should be a top priority for any company developing or deploying AI,” he offered.</p>\n<p>Existing SaaS vendors are adding AI into everything, introducing more risk. Government agencies should take this into account, he maintained.</p>\n<h3>US Response to AI Safety Needs</h3>\n<p>Thacker wants the U.S. government to take a faster and more deliberate approach to confronting the realities of missing AI safety standards. However, he praised the commitment of 16 major AI companies to prioritize the safety and responsible deployment of frontier AI models.</p>\n<p>“It shows growing awareness of the AI risks and a willingness to commit to mitigating them. However, the real test will be how well these companies follow through on their commitments and how transparent they are in their safety practices,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Still, his praise fell short in two key areas. He did not see any mention of consequences or aligning incentives. Both are extremely important, he added.</p>\n<p>According to Thacker, requiring AI companies to publish safety frameworks shows accountability, which will provide insight into the quality and depth of their testing. Transparency will allow for public scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“It may also force knowledge sharing and the development of best practices across the industry,” he observed.</p>\n<p>Thacker also wants quicker legislative action in this space. However, he thinks that a significant movement will be challenging for the U.S. government in the near future, given how slowly U.S. officials usually move.</p>\n<p>“A bipartisan group coming together to make these recommendations will hopefully kickstart a lot of conversations,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Still Navigating Unknowns in AI Regulations</h3>\n<p>The Global AI Summit was a great step forward in safeguarding AI’s evolution, agreed Melissa Ruzzi, director of artificial intelligence at AppOmni. Regulations are key.</p>\n<p>“But before we can even think about setting regulations, a lot more exploration needs to be done,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>This is where cooperation among companies in the AI industry to join initiatives around AI safety voluntarily is so crucial, she added.</p>\n<p>“Setting thresholds and objective measures is the first challenge to be explored. I don’t think we are ready to set those yet for the AI field as a whole,” said Ruzzi.</p>\n<p>It will take more investigation and data to consider what these may be. Ruzzi added that one of the biggest challenges is for AI regulations to keep pace with technology developments without hindering them.</p>\n<h3>Start by Defining AI Harm</h3>\n<p>According to David Brauchler, principal security consultant at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/\">NCC Group</a>, governments should consider looking into definitions of harm as a starting point in setting AI guidelines.</p>\n<p>As AI technology becomes more commonplace, a shift may develop from classifying AI’s risk from its training computational capacity. That standard was part of the recent U.S. executive order.</p>\n<p>Instead, the shift might turn toward the tangible harm AI may inflict in its execution context. He noted that various pieces of legislation hint at this possibility.</p>\n<p>“For example, an AI system that controls traffic lights ought to incorporate far more safety measures than a shopping assistant, even if the latter required more computational power to train,” Brauchler told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>So far, a clear view of regulation priorities for AI development and usage is lacking. Governments should prioritize the real impact on people in how these technologies are implemented. Legislation should not attempt to predict the long-term future of a rapidly changing technology, he observed.</p>\n<p>If a present danger emerges from AI technologies, governments can respond accordingly once that information is concrete. Attempts to pre-legislate those threats are likely to be a shot in the dark, clarified Brauchler.</p>\n<p>“But if we look toward preventing harm to individuals via impact-targeted legislation, we don’t have to predict how AI will change in form or fashion in the future,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Balancing Governmental Control, Legislative Oversight</h3>\n<p>Thacker sees a tricky balance between control and oversight when regulating AI. The result should not be stifling innovation with heavy-handed laws or relying solely on company self-regulation.</p>\n<p>“I believe a light-touch regulatory framework combined with high-quality oversight mechanisms is the way to go. Governments should set guardrails and enforce compliance while allowing responsible development to continue,” he reasoned.</p>\n<p>Thacker sees some analogies between the push for AI regulations and the dynamics around nuclear weapons. He warned that countries that achieve AI dominance could gain significant economic and military advantages.</p>\n<p>“This creates incentives for nations to rapidly develop AI capabilities. However, global cooperation on AI safety is more feasible than it was with nuclear weapons, as we have greater network effects with the internet and social media,” he observed.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The 2024 holiday shopping season won’t be the best for retailers. Not only is the Thanksgiving to Christmas window narrower than usual, but market watchers are predicting limp sales growth for the period.</p>\n<p>Salesforce, for example, predicts year-over-year global sales growth of 2% for November and December, totaling US$1.19 trillion, and 2% growth in the United States, reaching $277 billion. In 2023, YOY global sales growth was 3%, totaling $1.17 trillion.</p>\n<p>One change that could be for the better, though, is the emergence of artificial intelligence as a means to optimize retail performance and consumer satisfaction during the hectic holiday shopping season.</p>\n<p>“With Thanksgiving falling on November 28, the 2024 holiday shopping season will be shorter than usual, affecting assortment, pricing, and promotion strategies. The last time the season was so short was in 2019, pre-Covid. Those historic demand patterns are no longer reliable to predict this year’s,” said Martin Ryan, vice president of retail at <a href=\"https://www.epam.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EPAM Systems</a>, a software engineering services, digital platform engineering, and digital product design company, hadquartered in Newtown, Pa.</p>\n<p>“Retailers need to adapt their strategies for demand forecasting to avoid under- or overstocking,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “AI tools can be used to provide accurate and dynamic predictions based on data analysis from historical and current data from multiple sources.”</p>\n<p>“Social listening tools can gather real-time data about consumer preferences, which typically convert much faster into buying behavior during the holiday season when consideration time is compressed,” he added.</p>\n<h3>How AI Gift Suggestions Improve Holiday Shopping</h3>\n<p>However, Keri McGhee, CMO of <a href=\"https://www.attentive.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Attentive</a>, a global customer relations management company, pointed out that over the last few years holiday shopping has started earlier and earlier. “This year is no different,” she told E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>McGhee cited research by Forrester that found nearly 25% of U.S. online adults started shopping for the 2023 holiday season in October or earlier. “This year, we’re expecting the holiday season to start early again largely because of the shorter window between Thanksgiving and Christmas,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Brands that utilize AI tools early can quickly and effectively reach these customers for more conversions versus waiting until the traditional rush of Black Friday-Cyber Monday weekend,” she continued. “AI can bring BFCM promotions and news straight to customers early to see more sales throughout the season with exclusive or limited offers delivered via SMS or email.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>One way retailers use AI to reach shoppers is through gift recommendations. For example, Amazon offers “Rufus,” a generative AI-powered conversational shopping assistant that helps shoppers with everything from finding deals to selecting gifts to answering shopping questions.</p>\n<p>“Intelligent virtual assistants can help guide shoppers to find just the right gift by analyzing the recipient’s preferences — whether it’s for clothing, tech, or hobbies,” said Gopi Polavarapu, CSO of <a href=\"https://kore.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kore.ai</a>, a generative AI solutions provider, in Orlando, Fla.</p>\n<p>“This takes the guesswork out of gift-giving, saving time and reducing stress, especially during the holidays,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “For retailers, this means happier customers who are more likely to return, as the shopping experience feels more tailored to them.”</p>\n<h3>Gifts That Resonate</h3>\n<p>The average person wastes $71 on gifts that aren’t appreciated, observed Tina Wung, global vice president of marketing at <a href=\"https://www.nisum.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nisum</a>, a technology consulting firm based in Silicon Valley. “Retailers must help their shoppers address this gap,” she told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>“With vast data on customer behavior, AI is able to predict more accurately which products are suitable for specific characteristics,” she said. “This information can fine-tune large language models where customers can talk to AI and ask it for gift advice. AI chatbot ‘gift assistants’ can ask the shopper unique prompts to capture the necessary details about the giftee to help them choose the perfect gift.”</p>\n<p>“AI and relying on consumer data to predict and entice demand have never been more critical for retailers,” she added. “AI’s ability to understand customers intricately allows for successfully targeted shopping assistance. Consumers are 91% more likely to shop with brands that recognize and provide relevant recommendations, while 80% are more inclined to purchase when offered personalized experiences.”</p>\n<h3>Purchase Confidence With AI Personalization</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://jorgeargota.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jorge Argota</a>, a digital marketing and SEO expert in Miami, said that AI has changed the shopping experience for his customers when it comes to gift buying.</p>\n<p>“Personalized recommendations are now part of our online store,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “By analyzing individual preferences and shopping behavior, AI suggests gifts that resonate with each customer. Personalization makes shopping more fun and helps customers find meaningful gifts without the stress.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>He added that features like visual search and augmented reality have made gift buying more interactive. “Customers can upload a picture and find similar products in our inventory or use AR to see how a product would look in their home or on themselves,” he noted. “These tools not only make the shopping experience more fun but also reduce uncertainty so customers are more confident in their purchase.”</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can personalize gifts in another way, too. “By using natural language processing, AI can even consider the sentimental or emotional value of gifts based on conversations or social media activity. This level of personalization could make the process more efficient and meaningful, helping people choose thoughtful gifts with minimal effort,” Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<h3>Challenges Implementing AI in Retail Gift Shopping</h3>\n<p>AI now knows a lot about a customer’s browsing history, purchase patterns, and even their social media activity, so it could suggest personalized gift ideas that hit the mark every time, noted Blake Ellis, CTO of <a href=\"https://commercev3.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CommerceV3</a>, an e-commerce platform and service company, headquartered in Minneola, Fla. “We’re not quite there yet,” he told the E-Commerce Times, “but the potential is huge. It could revolutionize how people shop for others, making the whole gift-giving process smoother and more meaningful.”</p>\n<p>As powerful as AI-assisted gift-giving can be for retailers, it won’t be a slam dunk for them. “AI can increase consideration and close rates on sales significantly, but only if it is implemented well, and too few companies know how to implement it well this early in its young life,” warned Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“Where it works, it will pull people to the products they wouldn’t have otherwise considered and away from products they otherwise would have bought,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “Once it reaches scale, it will have a significant adverse impact on firms that haven’t figured out how to use it properly and a massive benefit to firms that do.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Kassi Socha, a consumer and culture analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn., also warned brands against deploying gimmicky AI-powered tools. “Brands who roll out gen AI-powered gift generators or digital holiday card makers that don’t have a clear connection to making the gift-giving process easier or more efficient may see low user adoption and engagement,” she told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore,” she added, “tools that are spun up as part of a marketing campaign versus integrated into the core shopping experience may have been rushed to production and more likely to hallucinate or produce results that don’t align with the shopper’s need nor intent. This could damage brand reputation.”</p>\n<h3>AI Demand Forecasting for Holiday Sales</h3>\n<p>Another area where AI will impact holiday sales is forecasting demand. For example, Amazon, which has been baking AI into its operations since 2020, has a collection of AI, machine learning, and other systems known as SCOT — Supply Chain Optimization Technologies — to make countless predictions, recommendations, and decisions every day.</p>\n<p>“Deploying novel predictive and generative techniques, the SCOT team has already produced a 10% improvement in our long-term forecasts,” Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>AI and demand forecasting are game-changers, maintained CommerceV3’s Ellis. “We’re talking next-level accuracy in predicting what products will fly off the shelves,” he said. “Machine learning algorithms can crunch massive amounts of data, past sales figures, social media trends, and even weather patterns, to give retailers a crystal ball for inventory planning. No more guesswork or overstocking. It’s all about getting the right products in the right place at the right time.”</p>\n<h3>Dynamic Inventory Management</h3>\n<p>“As an agency owner, I have seen firsthand how AI has changed our demand forecasting,” added Argota. “In the past, we would make educated guesses and use last year’s sales data to predict which products would be hot sellers during the holiday season. Now, AI algorithms look at our historical sales and market trends, economic indicators, and even seasonal patterns. We get super accurate forecasts so we can make informed decisions on inventory and resource allocation.”</p>\n<p>He also touted the real-time data processing capabilities of AI. “Consumer behavior during the holidays can change in an instant due to promotions or viral trends,” he explained. “With AI, we can adjust our strategies on the fly to match those changes. We don’t get caught off guard by demand spikes or drops, which is key to customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>In addition, he noted that AI has almost eliminated overstocking and stockouts. “By predicting demand exactly, we can have just the right amount of inventory on hand,” he said. “This reduces holding costs and means popular items are available when our customers want them. It’s a delicate balance, but AI has made it much easier to achieve.”</p>\n<p>“AI also helps us get ahead of the curve by identifying emerging trends,” he added. “By analyzing social media posts, search queries, and sales data, AI tools tell us what’s trending. This gives us the insight to stock up on trendy items that will be in high demand so we can meet customer expectations during the holiday rush.”</p>\n<h3>Balancing AI Innovation with Consumer Trust</h3>\n<p>In their rush to embrace AI, retailers need to be careful, cautioned Lija Hogan, an experience research strategy principal at <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UserTesting</a>, a customer experience research and insights company. “Retailers must understand how to balance personalizing the shopping experience without having it veer into being perceived as showing that the brand ‘knows too much’ about their customers,” she told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>“Successful AI integration will depend on retailers’ ability to prioritize customer trust and transparency,” she continued. “Integrating AI requires continual evaluation of the consumer/retail experience while addressing consumer privacy concerns, keeping customers informed on how their data is being used and understanding consumer attitudes towards AI tools.”</p>\n<p>She added, “Retail leaders who continuously refine their shopping experience based on customer feedback will be the most successful in today’s dynamic landscape.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A gaming platform is warning parents about gaming scams aimed at children.</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals are targeting young gamers, exploiting their innocence for financial gain, according to a report released Friday by <a href=\"https://www.mplgames.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile Premier League</a> (MPL), a popular gaming platform.</p>\n<p>Gaming scams pose grave risks to children’s safety, privacy, and financial security, particularly because younger people are more vulnerable, MPL noted.</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals may exploit personal information to commit identity theft, access bank accounts, or even engage in online harassment and cyberbullying, it added. Additionally, malware infections can compromise device security, exposing children to further risks.</p>\n<p>“Children are particularly vulnerable because they are less able to distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary compared to adults,” explained Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst with the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itif.org/\">Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation</a> (ITIF), a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>“Children may confuse fictional immersive experiences with real ones,” she told TechNewsWorld. “This is a normal part of a child’s cognitive and emotional development, but there are still questions as to how immersive experiences like gaming exacerbate this confusion.”</p>\n<p>Kimberly Sutherland, vice president of fraud and identity strategy at <a href=\"https://risk.lexisnexis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LexisNexis Risk Solutions</a>, a global data analytics and services company, added that scammers target kids for a number of reasons. “They can be targeted to get access to their parents’ information, or unfortunately, they’re often targeted for more harmful reasons, like for online sex crime and <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/new-report-finds-sharp-rise-in-sextortion-of-teen-boys-178635.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predatory activity</a>,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>7 Million Attacks</h3>\n<p>Earlier this year, cybersecurity products and services company Kaspersky reported that in 2022, its security solutions detected more than seven million attacks relating to popular children’s games, resulting in a 57% increase in attempted attacks compared to the previous year.</p>\n<p>The top children’s games by the number of users targeted included games for the youngest children — Poppy Playtime and Toca Life World — which are designed for three to eight-year-olds.</p>\n<p>“What raises even more concerns is that sometimes children prefer to communicate with strangers on gaming platforms rather than on social media,” Andrey Sidenko and Anna Larkina wrote on the <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kaspersky Daily</a> website.</p>\n<p>“In some games, unmoderated voice and text chats form a significant part of the experience,” they continued. “As more young people come online, criminals can build trust virtually, in the same way as they would entice someone in person — by offering gifts or promises of friendship.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Once they lure a young victim by gaining their trust, cybercriminals can obtain their personal information, suggesting they click on a phishing link, download a malicious file onto their device disguised as a game mod for Minecraft or Fortnite, or even groom them for more nefarious purposes,” they added.</p>\n<p>Sutherland noted that there are commonalities between how children and adults are targeted. “It’s ultimately about trust and often begins with grooming,” she said. “Looking at social media sites where people share information could be something that could be done for both a child and an adult.”</p>\n<p>“Trying to use fake information to present themselves — fake profiles, fake photos, something that allows the child or adult to connect with the fraudster — would be done to a child or an adult,” she added. “So establishing that relationship is very similar for adults and children.”</p>\n<h3>Scammers Favor Roblox</h3>\n<p>Spawning the bogus information predators need for their scams has become easier with the rise of artificial intelligence. “Artificial intelligence makes it easier to create fictitious identities,” Sutherland said. “The problem was bad before. And the ability to create fake profiles, fake voices that could represent a minor, has become even more difficult to detect with AI.”</p>\n<p>However, fraudsters also use differences between children and adults when crafting scams. “Scammers rely on psychological tricks to gain their targets’ trust and prevent them from asking too many questions,” explained Ashley Johnson, a senior policy manager at the ITIF.</p>\n<p>“These tricks may be more effective on certain populations, such as children, because children are less psychologically developed than adults,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>The MPL report also noted phishing attempts disguised as legitimate gaming websites or updates are also prevalent, tricking children into downloading malware or revealing sensitive data.</p>\n<p>According to Kaspersky data, phishing pages created by cybercriminals mostly targeted Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite, and Apex Legends games. In 2022, more than 878,000 phishing pages were made for these four games, 823,000 of which targeted Roblox alone.</p>\n<h3>How Parents Can Protect Kids From Gaming Scams</h3>\n<p>Ambrose argued that developers need to balance making a game compelling and entertaining while looking out for children’s best interests.</p>\n<p>“The video game industry, either voluntarily or due to proposed regulatory mandates, has introduced various measures to minimize the negative effects of gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes,” she said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“These measures include setting spending limits for underage accounts to $0 by default, disclosing every item included in a loot box’s pool alongside its drop rate — how likely a player is to get the best item — and imposing hourly and daily limits on purchases of loot boxes by an individual user.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to immersive games, such as AR/VR experiences, the expectation is that they will support and carry betting apps,” she added. “Therefore, it is important to understand that children may interact with these platforms and, as a result, may experience gambling-like situations and behaviors.”</p>\n<p>The MPL report made these recommendations to parents for protecting their children from online gaming scams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable parental controls and restrict in-app purchases to help prevent unauthorized spending.</li>\n<li>Educate children about safe online practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and never sharing personal information with strangers.</li>\n<li>Monitor gaming activities regularly and foster open communication with children to help identify potential threats early on.</li>\n<li>Encourage children to report any suspicious activities or requests for personal information immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Limiting online access with most children is the best approach,” Sutherland maintained. “Parents need to have parental control where they can monitor usage and access and limit children’s access to safe places online — age-appropriate gaming and social media sites.”</p>\n<p>“Setting clear boundaries, limiting screen time, and making sure they’re going to age-appropriate platforms and playing age-appropriate games is most important,” she said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The streaming television industry has been accused of operating a massive data-driven surveillance apparatus that is transforming TVs into sophisticated monitoring, tracking, and targeting devices.</p>\n<p>In a 48-page report released Monday, the Washington, D.C.-based <a href=\"https://democraticmedia.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Center for Digital Democracy</a> (CDD) outlined how the connected TV (CTV) industry captures and harvests information on individuals and families through a sophisticated and expansive commercial surveillance system, deliberately incorporating many of the data-gathering, monitoring, and targeting practices that have long undermined privacy and consumer protection online.</p>\n<p>“CTV has just replicated the commercial online surveillance ecosystem,” said CDD Executive Director Jeffrey Chester, who co-authored the report with Kathryn C. Montgomery.</p>\n<p>“They’ve simply recast the original sins they’ve done repeatedly online,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They’re working with data brokers now. They’re working with adtech companies. They’re working with measurement companies. So there’s this multilayered, connected television surveillance system that no individual can really address.”</p>\n<p>“It’s become a privacy nightmare because it’s happening throughout the television system, and regulators have really done nothing about it,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Creating Clandestine Digital Dossiers</h3>\n<p>According to the report, leading streaming video programming networks, CTV device companies, and “smart” TV manufacturers, allied with many of the country’s most powerful data brokers, are creating extensive digital dossiers on viewers based on a person’s identity information, viewing choices, purchasing patterns and thousands of online and offline behaviors.</p>\n<p>It also maintained that surveillance has been built directly into television sets, with major manufacturers’ smart TVs deploying automatic content recognition (ACR) and other monitoring software to capture an extensive, highly granular, and intimate amount of information that, when combined with contemporary identity technologies, enables tracking and ad targeting at the individual viewer level.</p>\n<p>“People watch TV in the privacy of their own homes and have a reasonable expectation that no one is watching them watch,” said Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a senior staff technologist at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eff.org\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, an international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“The trend of building surveillance into all new smart TVs is incredibly invasive and little understood,” he told TechNewsWorld. “When people buy a device, they expect that device to serve their needs, not the manufacturer’s desires. Nobody wants a snooping and snitching television, but lately, that’s all you can buy.”</p>\n<h3>Solution Looking for a Problem</h3>\n<p>Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., pointed out that while the report highlights the potential for problems, it doesn’t provide any hard evidence of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>In addition, he continued, using the harvested information to create more effective ads or better programming, which has largely been accepted by users as a tradeoff for better programming and advertisements that speak to them.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t much substance here, and the question must be asked of the user whether they are OK with this before acting with the assumption they aren’t,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Too often, we try to fix ‘problems’ that aren’t problems at all to the people affected by them, so care must be taken to assure the remedy addresses something people want fixed. Better programming and ads aren’t a problem to most users.”</p>\n<p>The report also noted that CTV has unleashed a powerful arsenal of interactive advertising techniques, including virtual product placement inserted into programming and altered in real time.

      "content": "<p>Search engines using artificial intelligence could harmfully disrupt the digital economy, warns a researcher at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center.</p>\n<p>“[I]f AI search becomes our primary portal to the web, it threatens to disrupt an already precarious digital economy,” Benjamin Brooks wrote in a recent article in the MIT Technology Review.</p>\n<p>“Today, the production of content online depends on a fragile set of incentives tied to virtual foot traffic: ads, subscriptions, donations, sales, or brand exposure,” he explained. “By shielding the web behind an all-knowing chatbot, AI search could deprive creators of the visits and ‘eyeballs’ they need to survive.”</p>\n<p>Brooks urged the AI industry to address the content compensation problem before others do it. “The AI industry should use this narrow window of opportunity to build a smarter content marketplace before governments fall back on interventions that are ineffective, benefit only a select few, or hamper the free flow of ideas across the web,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>“We need to bear in mind that these new systems, these new business models, are just taking off,” he added in an interview with TechNewsWorld, “but however we respond to these challenges, it’s important we do so in a thoughtful, measured and targeted way. That’s why industry should take the lead here.”</p>\n<p>“Government is now more confident regulating content and regulating bargaining than it ever was before,” he said. “The AI search industry should be mindful of that. With that additional pressure over the coming years, the industry should get ahead and build a smarter solution before government turns to blunter solutions.”</p>\n<h3>AI Search Impact Unclear</h3>\n<p>So far, the impact of AI search on the wallets of content creators is still foggy. “It’s not yet clear, but there is a strong argument to be made that there will be reduced traffic to many publishers,” said Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a news, commentary, and analysis website.</p>\n<p>“The evidence is mixed,” he told TechNewsWorld. “During the Google ‘SGE’ period, there was evidence that organic links were being pushed down the page and therefore [were] less visible.” Introduced in December 2023, Google’s Search Generative Experience provides overviews of search topics using AI.</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “there was little research on actual click behavior. Google claims that links within AI results get more engagement. We need to do more research on this issue.”</p>\n<p>Chris Ferris, senior vice president of digital strategy at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.piercom.com\">Pierpont Communications</a>, a public relations agency in Houston, added that AI search will exacerbate the problem that already exists with traditional search. “Most web pages don’t get any traffic from organic search,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He cited research published by Search Engine Land predicting that organic traffic will fall between 18% and 64% because of AI search.</p>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, noted there is growing evidence that AI-driven search, such as generative AI summaries in search engines, has caused a decline in click-through rates to content providers’ websites, as users increasingly consume information directly from AI responses.</p>\n<p>“News outlets and niche content creators have reported reduced traffic from traditional search sources when AI systems generate comprehensive answers,” he told TechNewsWorld. “While detailed impact studies are ongoing, this trend indicates potential risks to publishers’ ad revenue and visibility.”</p>\n<p>“Without doubt, AI-driven search tools risk reducing traffic to content providers’ sites, potentially undermining ad revenues and subscriber models,” he added.</p>\n<p>“Without users clicking through to original sources, content creators may struggle to monetize their work, threatening the sustainability of quality journalism and niche content. Balancing AI-driven convenience with adequate attribution and redirection to content providers will be essential to preserve a healthy digital content ecosystem.”</p>\n<h3>Eyeball Apocalypse Overblown</h3>\n<p>Dev Nag, CEO and founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.querypal.com\">QueryPal</a>, an enterprise chatbot based in San Francisco, asserted that the narrative that AI search will destroy content creation by stealing eyeballs fundamentally misunderstands how content ecosystems have evolved.</p>\n<p>“Think about how we transitioned from paid newspapers and centralized TV/movie studios to ad-supported online content,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Each shift brought predictions of doom, yet we ended up with far more content — and from more content creators — than ever.</p>\n<p>“AI is poised to dramatically expand content reach through better discovery, translation, and personalization. Rather than destroying the content economy, AI search is likely to create a more efficient marketplace where quality content finds its intended audience more effectively.”</p>\n<p>He contended that the evidence so far doesn’t support the “eyeball apocalypse” narrative.</p>\n<p>“While AI search is changing how people discover content, we’re seeing content creators adapt by producing more focused, high-quality material that AI systems can better understand and distribute,” he said. “The real transformation isn’t about losing eyeballs. It’s about shifting from a mass-market advertising model to more sophisticated monetization approaches.”</p>\n<p>Nag predicted two primary models emerging: “content licensing,” where creators get paid for allowing AI systems to learn from and reference their work, even if it’s available openly otherwise, such as the recent Google-Reddit agreement, and a “value-share” system, where AI platforms distribute revenue based on how often they reference and synthesize a creator’s content.</p>\n<p>“That’s currently possible with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAG-based systems</a> that are able to provide explicit references — like Perplexity — and could be adapted to systems which are directly trained through sophisticated attribution tracking,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“Search engines could do as TikTok and YouTube do and share their revenue to build up creators feeding their services,” added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“However, as AI advances,” he told TechNewsWorld, “it may need less and less human creators, which will be problematic to this future outcome.”</p>\n<p>Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out that AI search is the culmination of something seen over the course of decades.</p>\n<p>“Back in the day, long before AI, there was Ask Jeeves,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It didn’t execute on the idea very well, but the idea was, rather than get a whole bunch of links, you got an answer. In many cases, that’s what the person searching wants. It’s a better experience to be given information up front and not have to piece it together or track it down from multiple information sources.”</p>\n<h3>Downside of Big Content Deals</h3>\n<p>In his article, Brooks was critical of AI companies cutting deals with big media companies to avoid litigation or government intervention. “This policy of selective appeasement is untenable,” he wrote. “It neglects the vast majority of creators online, who cannot readily opt out of AI search and who do not have the bargaining power of a legacy publisher.”</p>\n<p>“It takes the urgency out of reform by mollifying the loudest critics,” he continued. “It legitimizes a few AI firms through confidential and intricate commercial deals, making it difficult for new entrants to obtain equal terms or equal indemnity and potentially entrenching a new wave of search monopolists.”</p>\n<p>“In the long term, it could create perverse incentives for AI firms to favor low-cost and low-quality sources over high-quality but more expensive news or content, fostering a culture of uncritical information consumption in the process,” he added.</p>\n<p>At this point in the development of AI search, Sterling said it’s still too early to tell how the game will play out. “We have many assumptions and fears but need to test them and produce real data so that we’re not operating from a place of pure conjecture,” he observed.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Inflation is causing many consumers to pass on upgrading to a new cell phone this year, according to a survey conducted by an online personal finance platform.</p>\n<p>The survey of more than 210 respondents, using data normalized by age, gender, and income so the sample would reflect U.S. demographics, found that nearly two in three Americans (63%) said they wouldn’t buy a new cell phone this year because of inflation.</p>\n<p>“Inflation is certainly a significant factor in driving down smartphone purchases, but it’s important to recognize that consumers are getting smarter about where they allocate their resources,” noted Scott Dylan, founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nexatechventures.com\">NexaTech Ventures</a>, a venture capital firm in Manchester, England.</p>\n<p>“With phones lasting longer and more affordable options on the market,” he told TechNewsWorld, “inflation may be accelerating a shift that was already happening — where the days of annual upgrades are becoming a thing of the past.”</p>\n<p>Dev Nag, CEO and founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.querypal.com\">QueryPal</a>, an enterprise chatbot based in San Francisco, added: “It’s important to note that while inflation may delay purchases for some, smartphones have become essential tools for many people’s personal and professional lives. This necessity may lead some consumers to prioritize phone purchases even in challenging economic times.”</p>\n<p>“Additionally,” he told TechNewsWorld, “the trend towards keeping phones longer may accelerate due to economic pressures, potentially impacting the smartphone industry’s traditional upgrade cycles and revenue models.”</p>\n<h3>Inflation-Resistant Phones</h3>\n<p>Ordinarily, inflation doesn’t affect luxury items, but the iPhone is an exception, asserted Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore. “iPhones sell into non-wealthy segments,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This should have eroded Apple’s brand image as a luxury brand, but it has not. Inflation has a far bigger impact on middle-class and below buyers than it does on the wealthy.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, while inflation has hit the prices of many products, flagship smartphones have been, for the most part, inflation-resistant. “Most of the price increases have been limited to premium models,” noted Max McCaskill, a staff writer with <a href=\"https://www.whistleout.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhistleOut</a>, a search engine for cell phone and internet services.</p>\n<p>“The iPhone 16 has maintained the [US]$799 starting price that began with the iPhone 12 of 2020,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The $799 release price of the Samsung Galaxy S24 was the same as the S21 from 2021. Google is the only company to buck this trend by consistently raising the prices of the Pixel for the past two years.”</p>\n<p>There are reasons other than inflation that can discourage consumers from buying a new phone. “Economic insecurity and job insecurity are more likely factors in the decision to delay purchasing a new phone than inflation,” Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a news, commentary, and analysis website, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Consumers sometimes take the approach of ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’” added <a href=\"https://wallethub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WalletHub</a> writer Chip Lupo.</p>\n<p>“My current iPhone 12 works fine. I’ll use it until it’s no longer supported. Then I’ll look at upgrading it,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Diminishing Feature Returns</h3>\n<p>Consumers are also increasingly making their new phone an old phone. “We’ve certainly seen replacement cycles lengthen. We’ve seen a lot of growth in the refurbished and used categories, too,” explained Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Smartphones are a mature device category at this point,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Take Apple’s announcement this week. They continued to advance the platform, but things like the camera control button are probably not going to be something that’s going to spur a lot of people to scream, ‘I have to have this now!’ and then throw their current phones in the trash.”</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing diminishing returns in terms of significant advancements between model upgrades,” NexaTech’s Dylan added.</p>\n<p>“Consumers are holding onto their devices longer because the improvements — whether in processing power, camera quality, or software — are becoming incremental rather than groundbreaking,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Dylan noted that sustainability concerns are also starting to influence purchase decisions. “Many consumers, particularly younger ones, are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of upgrading every year,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“There’s also the rise of software longevity,” he said, “with companies offering extended software support for older models, making it easier for users to keep their devices for longer without sacrificing functionality.”</p>\n<h3>Phone Link to Self-Worth</h3>\n<p>The survey also found that more than two in five Americans think a new iPhone is worth accumulating debt for. WalletHub’s Lupo was a bit bewildered by that finding. “I’m surprised anyone would think it’s okay to go into debt to get an iPhone,” he said. “You take on debt for a home, maybe for a vehicle, but for an iPhone? I think two out of five is too high.”</p>\n<p>“The willingness of some consumers to go into debt for the latest iPhone speaks to the strength of Apple’s brand and marketing,” added QueryPal’s Nag.</p>\n<p>“Apple has successfully positioned its products as premium, desirable items that are worth stretching one’s budget for,” he continued. “This reflects both the perceived quality and status associated with Apple products.”</p>\n<p>“However,” he said, “it also highlights potential issues with consumer financial literacy and the power of marketing to influence purchasing decisions, sometimes against consumers’ best financial interests.”</p>\n<p>Another survey finding is that 42% of Americans think having the latest iPhone is important for their self-image. Further findings included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nine out of 10 Americans think iPhones are overpriced.</li>\n<li>30% of people categorize someone who always has the newest iPhone as rich, while 27% think of them as wasteful.</li>\n<li>65% of people think Apple is a monopoly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Smartphones have evolved into an extension of our identities,” Dylan said. “In many ways, they’re not just tools for communication but are markers of success, personal taste, and even social currency.”</p>\n<p>“The technology we carry signals to others how connected, productive, and affluent we are,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“The culture of regular upgrades, particularly among the younger demographic, feeds into this cycle,” he added. “Apple and Samsung have done an exceptional job at positioning their devices as luxury products, much like designer clothing or cars, making it easy for people to link their self-image to the phones they carry.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The gurus at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a> released their list of top 10 strategic technology trends to watch in 2025 on Monday — a list heavily influenced by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>“This year’s top strategic technology trends span AI imperatives and risks, new frontiers of computing and human-machine synergy,” Gartner Vice President Analyst Gene Alvarez said in a statement. “Tracking these trends will help IT leaders shape the future of their organizations with responsible and ethical innovation.”</p>\n<p>At the top of the list were <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/agentic-ai-set-to-revolutionize-business-operations-decision-making-179374.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agentic AI</a> systems, which can autonomously plan and execute actions based on user-defined goals. By 2028, the firm predicted that at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions would be made autonomously through Agentic AI, up from 0% in 2024.</p>\n<p>“Agentic AI is definitely the future of the enterprise workforce,” said Ambuj Kumar, founder of <a href=\"https://simbian.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simbian</a>, a provider of autonomous AI agents for cybersecurity, in Mountain View, Calif.</p>\n<p>“Imagine a field like security where there is a 3.5 million worker shortage, overworked employees, and the need for constant learning about emerging threats,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Against that landscape, how attractive would be an offering that provides virtual employees who are always trained with the latest and greatest, cost 10 times less than humans, work 24×7, and can be scaled elastically based on business demands? That’s the promise of AI Agents.”</p>\n<h3>Agentic AI Challenges</h3>\n<p>To obtain the penetration predicted by Gartner, though, Agentic AI technology will have to surmount some challenges. “Designing effective Agentic AI systems is still experimental,” explained Sandi Besen, an applied AI researcher at IBM and <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.neudesic.com\">Neudesic</a>, a global professional services company.</p>\n<p>“As AI engineers and solution architects continue to refine their approaches, the field will evolve,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Many popular Agentic frameworks approach the design of creating an AI system differently. Currently, popular frameworks like LangChain and Autogen rely heavily on language models to make decisions, while others, like LangGraph, integrate AI agents into more structured, rule-based workflows.</p>\n<p>“The success of these systems depends on how they are designed, which is still an evolving area. We will likely see both successes and failures before industry-wide best practices emerge.”</p>\n<p>What’s more, she added, “The willingness of businesses to adopt these evolving systems will also be a major factor in the scalability and long-term success of Agentic AI.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“As AI advances, it has the potential to further improve productivity and provide workers with new ways to solve problems,” said Jennifer Huddleston, a technology policy research fellow at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank.</p>\n<p>“There are many different ways this could occur, and some will be industry-specific and quite significant, while others will be more subtle,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The exact incorporation of AI and the productivity gains from AI will, of course, vary depending on the role and the industry, but it is important policy does not try to predict all the potential uses and allow industry and technology to provide beneficial options to solve a wide range of challenges.”</p>\n<h3>AI Governance Platforms</h3>\n<p>Gartner also recommended organizations consider deploying AI governance platforms. Those platforms have the capability to create, manage, and enforce policies for responsible AI use, explain how AI systems work, and provide transparency to build trust and accountability, it explained.</p>\n<p>Gartner predicted that by 2028, organizations that implement comprehensive AI governance platforms will experience 40% fewer AI-related ethical incidents compared to those without such systems.</p>\n<p>“Without question, AI governance is crucial for mitigating ethical incidents because it provides structured oversight and accountability in AI development and deployment,” said Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“By implementing clear policies and frameworks, organizations can ensure that AI systems align with ethical standards, such as fairness, transparency, and non-bias,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Governance platforms also help in monitoring and auditing AI behavior, making it easier to detect and address potential risks early,” he added. “Without proper governance, organizations are more likely to face issues such as discriminatory outcomes, privacy violations, and regulatory non-compliance.”</p>\n<h3>Addressing Disinformation</h3>\n<p>Gartner also predicted more organizations will be investing in disinformation security. By 2028, it forecasted that 50% of enterprises will begin adopting products, services or features explicitly designed to address disinformation security use cases, up from less than 5% today.</p>\n<p>“Disinformation drives bad decisions, and it is particularly problematic for AIs,” said Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“The AIs will be making decisions on this bad information far more rapidly, making post-decision mitigation nearly impossible by humans,” he told TechNewsWorld. “So solving the disinformation problem becomes even more critical for AIs than it is with humans.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Vena added that disinformation can harm enterprises by damaging their reputation, as false information spreads quickly and can lead to public distrust.</p>\n<p>“It can also result in financial losses if disinformation disrupts operations, influences stock prices, or misguides customers,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Additionally,” he continued, “disinformation can create security vulnerabilities by manipulating employees, leading to poor decision-making or increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks.”</p>\n<h3>Postquantum Cryptography</h3>\n<p>Postquantum cryptography also needs to be on organizations’ radar in 2025. Quantum computing developments are expected to end several types of conventional cryptography that are now widely used, Gartner explained. It predicted that by 2029, advances in quantum computing will make most conventional asymmetric cryptography unsafe to use.</p>\n<p>“I fully agree with Gartner’s statement,” said Florian Neukart, chief product officer at <a href=\"https://terraquantum.swiss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Terra Quantum</a>, a quantum as a service provider in St. Gallen, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>“The prediction for 2029 is realistic given the rapid advances in quantum computing,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Conventional asymmetric cryptography, particularly <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rsa.com/\">RSA</a> and ECC, are vulnerable to quantum attacks, such as Shor’s algorithm, which can break these systems. Organizations must start transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic solutions now. Switching cryptographic methods requires significant lead time to ensure sensitive data remains secure in a quantum future.”</p>\n<p>Duncan Jones, head of cybersecurity at <a href=\"https://www.quantinuum.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quantinuum</a>, an international quantum computing hardware and software company, asserted Gartner’s prediction misses an important point. “What’s important is the date when organizations must take the threat seriously,” he told TechNewsWorld. “And that date has already passed.”</p>\n<h3>Neuromancer by 2030?</h3>\n<p>Another strategic technology identified by Gartner is neurological enhancement. It maintains that the tech will have huge potential in three areas: human upskilling, next-generation marketing, and performance. Neurological enhancement will enhance cognitive abilities, enable brands to know what consumers are thinking and feeling, and enhance human neural capabilities to optimize outcomes, it noted.</p>\n<p>It predicted that by 2030, 30% of knowledge workers will be enhanced by and dependent on technologies such as bidirectional brain-machine interfaces. Enderle disputed Gartner’s forecast. “Right now, the technology is very limited and requires a level of training for just reading the brain that won’t scale,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Feeding information back into the brain hasn’t been sorted yet, at least not publicly,” he explained. “Given the lack of progress here, I think the 2030 prediction is unreliable.”</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “AI is speeding up a significant amount of development in this area, making it at least possible, if not probable, that this prediction will be accurate.”</p>\n<p>“When bidirectional information can flow from and to a brain using these brain-machine interfaces, that will be the true beginning of the Singularity, but given where the technology now is, any timeline would be little more than a slightly educated guess.”</p>\n<p>Other strategic technologies in the Gartner spotlight included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater use of ambient invisible intelligence through ultra-low cost, small smart tags, and sensors will enable a deeper integration of sensing and intelligence into everyday life.</li>\n<li>Growth of energy-efficient computing, with an expectation that by late 2020s, several new compute technologies, such as optical, neuromorphic, and novel accelerators, will emerge for special purpose tasks, such as AI and optimization, which will use significantly less energy.</li>\n<li>Greater use of hybrid computing to create highly efficient transformative innovation environments that perform more effectively than conventional environments.</li>\n<li>Growth of spatial computing to enhance the physical world with augmented and virtual reality, becoming a US$1.7 trillion market by 2033.</li>\n<li>Proliferation of polyfunctional robots — robots that can perform more than one task at a time — so that by 2030, 80% of humans will engage with a smart robot on a daily basis.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<p>A substantial number of workers are using ChatGPT to get pay raises and promotions, according to survey results recently released by a resume resource website.</p>\n<p>Some 38% of workers say ChatGPT helped them land a pay raise, and 29% say it helped them secure a promotion, according to a survey of 1,666 U.S. employees who spend most or all of their workday on a computer conducted by <a href=\"https://www.resumetemplates.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ResumeTemplates</a>.</p>\n<p>Workers told researchers that ChatGPT has helped them complete tasks more quickly (64%), be more productive (62%), and reduce stress levels (50%).</p>\n<p>In addition, workers reported the generative AI tool allowed them to more efficiently problem-solve (49%), enhance skills and knowledge (46%), improve job satisfaction (43%), and achieve better project outcomes (41%).</p>\n<p>What’s more, they say the tool allowed for greater innovation in their work (36%), improved job security (29%), better team collaboration (31%), and more recognition from colleagues and supervisors (19%).</p>\n<h3>Reinvesting Time Into Company</h3>\n<p>“Employers are not only open to it, but in some cases, we see employers encouraging it,” ResumeTemplates’ Executive Resume Writer and Career Coach Andrew Stoner told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>That’s likely because employers know it’s making their employees more productive. According to the survey, 56% of respondents said their employers knew how much time ChatGPT saved their employees.</p>\n<p>Moreover, much of the time freed by ChatGPT is being reinvested into organizations. Some 60% of employees said they reinvested some of the time they saved with ChatGPT into company tasks, while 33% invested all of it back into the company.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/time-saved-chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"Chart: How Much Time Per Week ChatGPT Saves Workers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/time-saved-chatgpt.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/time-saved-chatgpt-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/time-saved-chatgpt-768x415.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>“In our research, we’ve seen a top benefit of using generative AI is the technology’s ability to alleviate or automate tedious and manual tasks,” said Thomas Vick, senior regional director for Illinois, Tennessee, and Missouri for <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/\">Robert Half</a>, a global staffing and recruiting firm.</p>\n<p>“With this additional time, workers can engage in more strategic thinking and problem-solving activities that might be seen as higher-value initiatives for businesses,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Learning the best utilization of these tools and how to incorporate them into your workflows can certainly help propel your career.”</p>\n<p>“If employees are more efficient by using AI and are not creating ethical issues, we’ll see it more and more becoming a prerequisite,” Stoner added. “Employers will be looking for employees who know how to use the technology and integrate it into their work.”</p>\n<h3>Transformative Workplace Impact</h3>\n<p>At Phoenix-based <a href=\"https://impacthealthusa.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Impact Health USA</a>, a health care solutions platform, CEO and Founder Josh Thompson said the company believes in leveraging AI to boost productivity and drive professional growth. “This survey underscores the potential for AI to play a pivotal role in career advancement,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“ChatGPT is a powerful tool that enhances worker productivity and efficiency,” he observed. “Employees can use it to draft professional emails, generate detailed reports, brainstorm innovative ideas, and quickly learn new skills. These enhancements can significantly improve work quality and performance, making employees more valuable to their organizations and increasing their chances for raises and promotions.”</p>\n<p>“It’s intriguing that 38% of workers attribute their raises to ChatGPT,” he said. “This highlights the transformative impact of AI tools in the workplace.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/professional-impact-chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"Chart: Ways Workers Say Using ChatGPT Has\nImpacted Their Professional Experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/professional-impact-chatgpt.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/professional-impact-chatgpt-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/professional-impact-chatgpt-768x507.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Modern AI, like ChatGPT, is a highly customizable knowledge synthesizer, so it’s no surprise workers have been able to leverage it for raises and promotions, added Dev Nag, CEO and founder of San Francisco-based <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.querypal.com\">QueryPal</a>, an enterprise chatbot.</p>\n<p>“Since it came out, people have been using it to learn new skills — with an infinitely patient tutor, accelerate everyday tasks like analysis and content creation, think through strategic plans, do faster research and summarization than search engines can, write software faster, and even modulate their communication to a given audience — whether external customers or co-workers,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“All of these were available to workers before, but AI just helps them do it so much faster than ever before, and it’s not surprising that their increased productivity would result in raises and even promotions.</p>\n<p>“Now, no one expects an information worker to get their job done with a pencil and paper anymore,” he continued. “We understand that workers will be using some kind of computing device at essentially all times and that some will be better at using it than others.”</p>\n<p>“We’re moving toward an economy where what was true for computing, in general, will be true for AI specifically,” he said. “We expect everyone to leverage AI and raise the performance bar accordingly. To quote William Gibson, the future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed.”</p>\n<h3>Perils of AI</h3>\n<p>Using AI tools, even if they can contribute to a pay bump or promotion, can entail a lot of risks, noted Alon Yamin, CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://copyleaks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copyleaks</a>, an AI-based text analysis and plagiarism company in New York City.</p>\n<p>“Information can be inaccurate. It can be plagiarized,” he told TechNewsWorld. “So what’s important when working with these solutions is to make sure you have tools in place that can mitigate those risks.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>One risk users should be careful to avoid is data leakage. “When using platforms like OpenAI’s, there is no guarantee that the information submitted will remain confidential,” cautioned Keaun Amani, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://neurosnap.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neurosnap</a>, a software engineering and molecular biology company in Wilmington, Del.</p>\n<p>“It is crucial for users in business to be mindful of the sensitive information they share through such platforms to minimize the risk of data leakage,” he told TechNewsWorld. “But other than that, I firmly believe that people should use the best tools at their disposal.”</p>\n<h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>\n<p>There may also be some ethical challenges for AI users. “It’s not an ethical problem to use AI to generate content or to analyze a situation, but it’s definitely a problem if that usage isn’t disclosed and understood by the ultimate recipient of that content or analysis,” Nag explained.</p>\n<p>“They might have specific expectations that the worker is leveraging their own specific background, or has taken pains not to include copyrighted material, or fully understands the unspoken rules and preferences of that organization,” he explained. “These expectations can be violated when using AI naively.”</p>\n<p>Ed Dodson, an instructor at <a href=\"https://www.hgsss.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Henry George School of Social Science</a> in New York City, recommended a person’s performance be evaluated utilizing multiple measures, including interpersonal skills, problem-solving ability, and creative approaches to achieving desired outcomes.</p>\n<p>“If the use of AI strengthens what the person knows and is capable of, then AI is useful,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If AI is used to hide shortcomings, these shortcomings are certain to become known under conditions of stress and time constraints.”</p>\n<p>But David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank, sees AI as just a tool to improve a worker’s capabilities, as other workplace tools do.</p>\n<p>“The computer greatly enhanced the abilities of workers in the office, and that didn’t make it unethical for some workers to use this advantage,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Similarly, if AI tools are used by workers to get hired for better jobs or ask for a raise, that is little different than making use of a friend or job service that can help you craft a strong resume or performance evaluation.”</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The charts featured in this article are credited to ResumeTemplates.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>A new approach to personalized computer instruction could help mitigate the impact of teacher shortages, understaffed classrooms, and lackluster self-learning, issues that have worsened since the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The EdYOU solution is built around an AI-powered learning tool that uses a visionary approach to enhance learning experiences for students and career-changing adults.</p>\n<p>According to data from Education Week, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, an estimated 270,000 teachers and staff quit or retire across the country every year. The pandemic worsened the teacher shortage situation. Over the last few years, 41 states and the District of Columbia faced shortages in at least one subject area or grade level.</p>\n<p>Most states now have more vacant positions and underqualified teachers in classrooms than in previous years. Last year ended with over 55,000 teacher vacancies nationwide for grades K-12. The U.S. Department of Education defines three types of teacher shortages: unfilled positions, positions filled by underqualified teachers, and positions filled by teachers in a different subject than their certification.</p>\n<p>Enrollment for teacher certification programs is declining or stagnating. Most states have seen a sharp increase in teachers exiting their classrooms in the last two years compared to the previous decade. Even worse, surveys revealed that a growing percentage of remaining teachers (12%) were dissatisfied with their jobs. More than four in 10 teachers shared they were likely to leave their jobs within two years.</p>\n<p>To help solve the teacher shortage, Michael Everest, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://edyou.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">edYOU</a>, pioneered a creative method to overcome the challenges traditional teaching methods pose. By offering personalized tutoring and learning tools, edYOU empowers students and educators alike, bridging gaps left by staffing shortages and ensuring students receive the attention they deserve.</p>\n<p>“I started edYOU with a passion for improving the downward trend in education outcomes. EdYOU is the first AI company that is not a chatbot but utilizes human-like meta-humans [animations] to teach conversationally in real time, not using recorded videos,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Adaptive AI Avatars for Academic Support</h3>\n<p>This approach is rooted in adaptability. Everest developed the three avatars available on the platform, which are safe AI entities. Each offers personalized and continuous support, fostering interactive communication and delivering a distinctive learning experience, he explained.</p>\n<p>EdYOU has APIs that allow easy integration with common education software for classrooms, learning management systems, and enterprise tools. Users of all ages can log onto the website and use a web browser or mobile app to select the type of academic support and subject matter they need.</p>\n<p>As students study, they can request their AI avatar companion to help tutor them or explain concepts so they can learn at their own pace. During the preparation of multiple-choice questions, for instance, Hannah, Nova, or Eddie (shown above) can assist by guiding the choice of correct answers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/edYOU-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"edYOU dashboard\" width=\"1420\" height=\"799\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/edYOU-dashboard.jpg 1420w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/edYOU-dashboard-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/edYOU-dashboard-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/edYOU-dashboard-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1420px) 100vw, 1420px\"></p>\n<p>Students can select subject areas and easily engage with their study buddy avatars, as shown in this screenshot from the company’s YouTube video demonstrating the on-screen learning system.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If the student makes an error, the digital didactic tutor provides a comprehensive explanation of what went wrong and why. This approach facilitates a deeper understanding and learning from mistakes.</p>\n<h3>Expanding Knowledge Without Digital Distress</h3>\n<p>The edYOU platform leverages AI to ensure a safe and effective educational experience in any environment, whether at home or school. In essence, the life-like avatar becomes a personal study buddy.</p>\n<p>Students bypass having to type questions in on-screen terminal windows and having to read detailed replies. Instead, natural-sounding conversations, initiated by clicking the microphone icon, allow free-flowing exchanges.</p>\n<p>All conversations are encrypted. Student data is anonymized and aggregated before in-house technicians monitor voice tracks. Parents can view transcripts and recordings of their child’s sessions, providing transparency into lessons.</p>\n<p>EdYOU support agents are available 24/7 via in-app chat, email, and phone contact. Students and parents can always reach a real person. The teaching team consists of Ph.D. scientists, former teachers, child development experts, data ethics experts, and experienced AI researchers and engineers.</p>\n<h3>Adaptability Makes All the Difference</h3>\n<p>This type of guided approach differs from other computer-assisted and guidebook-style learning solutions, offered Everest. Students can ask their avatars questions to get correct answers or help with test prep.</p>\n<p>The platform uses natural language processing (NLP) to tailor personalized conversations to each learner’s interests and knowledge. It does not simply regurgitate internet information. The unique conversational “AI beings” build mentor-like relationships with students to provide next-level customized education.</p>\n<p>According to Everest, EdYOU’s push for adaptability is also a big factor in its success ratings. Many existing solutions aim for a program that does it all. He contends that you must teach AI programs to change tactics and present non-robotic personalities to each user.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“That philosophy drives edYOU, making it universal but still personal,” he said.</p>\n<p>Traditional education operates under a one-size-fits-all model, with very little diversification in how students can learn. It is well-documented that attention spans are low in school, Everest continued. Not so with avatar-based presentations.</p>\n<p>If students do not understand something, they can actively seek out the information. Unlike in traditional classroom settings, students do not need to feel anxious or hesitant about asking for help in front of their peers for fear of looking “dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Many factors need to be considered, such as certain questions being hard to find directly answered online, and even then, it may only be the answer without context,” Everest explained about why other solutions may not meet every student’s needs.</p>\n<h3>Why the Platform Works for Students, Teachers</h3>\n<p>Curriculum updates in schools and other programmed learning software are scarce. Students use textbooks printed as far back as 10 years alongside outdated teaching methods.</p>\n<p>“It is challenging to cater to success for all when students are lumped together, and some teachers have up to 100 students. The current system works, but it is not designed to promote higher success rates, as these numbers continue to fall each year,” observed Everest.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The AI technology creates personalized tutoring based on participant interaction and data insights gained from them. It is similar to one-on-one virtual tutoring, supported by the vast knowledge of AI and expert-collected information.</p>\n<p>The teaching tool encourages the safe use of <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/ai-raises-bigger-concerns-for-students-than-teachers-admins-study-179695.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI in education</a>. According to Everest, responsible AI enables teachers to enhance their effectiveness while prioritizing their well-being.</p>\n<p>“This type of AI platform can serve as a valuable assistant to teachers and educators, providing support and enhancing the learning experience. It should be properly filtered to ensure factual accuracy and alignment with the approved curriculum,” he said.</p>\n<p>“This support level can be incredibly empowering for individuals who may otherwise feel discouraged and overwhelmed,” he noted.</p>\n<h3>Advancing the Future of Education</h3>\n<p>Everest insists this controlled use of instructional AI is the future of modern education. He wanted people not to feel like they were only interacting with tech, which is how the idea of an avatar came about.</p>\n<p>Developing the AI platform was not an easy endeavor. It was a lengthy process that ended up looking very different from the initial vision.</p>\n<p>“It took years of researching different developers and going through many trial attempts to get it as meta-human as I had imagined,” said Everest of his developmental journey.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Well, it’s that time of year again. Like you, I’m working through the gift-giving part of the holidays. I used to send out Amazon gift cards until one was stolen. I didn’t get sympathy or a refund from Amazon, so I’ve decided to steer clear of store gift cards altogether. So, I’m back to sending people things I think they might want, and this week, I’ll share my list of tech gadgets that make great gifts.</p>\n<p>I’ll close with my last Product of the Week for 2024, a new off-road electric motorcycle from Dust Moto due out next year that is being built almost in my backyard.</p>\n<h3>Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</h3>\n<p>Do you have a special lady in your life? Wife, sister, mother, daughter or girlfriend? Well, the best, but far from the cheapest, hair dryer I’ve found is the <a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dyson Supersonic</a>. It’s normally priced around $430, but I found it on sale for $329. I got one for my wife, and she loved it, so I got one for my sister this year, but don’t tell her!</p>\n<p>This hair dryer is relatively small, which makes it easy to pack. It comes up to speed quickly and holds up well. We haven’t had any problems with ours so far.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Dyson Supersonic™ hair dryer: Engineered for different hair types.\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGWFqeT9UcQ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The Supersonic uses Dyson’s unique design, which pulls the air from low in the handle, so it is unlikely to suck up your hair, and it has adjustments for every hair type, making it extremely flexible. It does come with a host of attachments, as is typical for anything Dyson-made. Don’t ask me to explain all the features because I don’t use them myself.</p>\n<p>This is my gift idea for someone you care about because it is well-made and expensive. It’s unlikely they’d buy it for themselves, and they will likely think fondly of you when they dry their hair.</p>\n<h3>Nixplay Digital Touchscreen Picture Frame</h3>\n<p>For the older folks in your life — parents, grandparents, uncles, or aunts — who might not be great with technology but who love family pictures, consider a digital picture frame you can preload with family pictures. When connected to the web, like the <a href=\"https://www.nixplay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nixplay digital touchscreen picture frame</a>, you can update the picture playlist from the comfort of your couch once the device is set up.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Perfect Holiday Gift: Nixplay Digital Picture Frames\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwR8FlgqhX4\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Yes, you’ll have to make sure the recipient’s Wi-Fi is working, which is a good reason to visit rather than just sending the thing out. At 10.1 inches and for around $140 (the 15-inch is on sale for $244 right now), it won’t be too big for a bedside table, and it works with both iOS and Android phones.</p>\n<p>Although they say a grandma could upload pictures to the frame, it’s better if you manage it yourself. Regularly updating the pictures turns the frame into an ongoing surprise and a thoughtful reminder that you’re thinking of them. Parents often struggle to feel connected after their kids move out, especially when those kids have their own families. This gift can help bridge that gap, serving as a simple but meaningful way to show you care.</p>\n<h3>70mai Dash Cam Omni</h3>\n<p>I was in a terrible car accident last year where an airbag knocked me out and broke my back. Because I was hit so hard, I have little memory of the accident, but my <a href=\"https://70mai.store/collections/single-dash-cam/products/omni-dashcam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70mai Dash Cam Omni</a> caught the entire event, so I was able to go back and learn from it.</p>\n<p>What makes this dash cam different is that it has a head like R2D2 that swivels, so you don’t have to have a rear-view camera. It will follow the action as it moves from side to side, capturing the entire event. It will also record people who mess with your car while it is parked. While it isn’t as good as what Teslas typically ship with, for those of us who don’t drive a Tesla, this is a great way to record your drive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/70mai-dash-cam-omni-360.jpg\" alt=\"360-degree dash cam by 70mai with swiveling head\" width=\"720\" height=\"687\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/70mai-dash-cam-omni-360.jpg 720w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/70mai-dash-cam-omni-360-300x286.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"></p>\n<p>Image Credit: 70mai</p>\n<p>It can also get you out of bogus tickets. I got one of those a few years back where the officer said I was doing 90 on an open road. I wasn’t, and I was in heavy traffic. It was my word against his, and he won. If I’d had the camera back then, it would have paid for itself with that one ticket.</p>\n<p>This dash cam can also reinforce the need to drive more safely, given the record you are creating can be used against you. If you have kids who borrow your car, you might want to consider this to keep them from doing stupid things. At $200, it’s one of the more reasonable dash cams out there.</p>\n<p>Oh, and there are a lot of insurance scammers out there who will back into your car and scream that you rear-ended them or throw themselves in front of your vehicle, claiming you didn’t yield. This camera can help you get out of those situations as well.</p>\n<h3>VolteX Heated Scarf</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179492\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179492\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/VolteX-heated-scarf.jpg\" alt=\"Voltex heated scarf\" width=\"400\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/VolteX-heated-scarf.jpg 400w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/VolteX-heated-scarf-300x244.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179492\"><span>Image Credit: VolteX</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Living in Bend, Oregon, where winters can be harsh, I’ve come to appreciate heated gear. The <a href=\"https://www.voltexheatedscarf.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VolteX Heated Scarf</a> is one of the easiest self-heated items in the market.</p>\n<p>At under $17, this is a handy gift for those on a budget. You have to charge it up, but it heats almost instantly once turned on and has three heat settings (just like my heated car seats).</p>\n<p>The scarf is fluffy, so it feels really good on your neck. I bought one for my wife this year because she hates the cold. She can leave it in the car plugged into the car’s electric system, so it’s always ready for the cold when a little instant warmth is appreciated.</p>\n<p>It is very portable, so you can travel with it, though since it has a battery, you’ll need to carry it onboard and not leave it in your luggage. It comes in brown, black, gray, or white. I ended up getting two in different colors since I’m going to want to wear one as well.</p>\n<h3>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</h3>\n<p>Things are getting a bit crazy, given all of the political tension in the air. I’ve been in several situations where I wanted to record what was happening without experiencing the anger that usually comes when you use your smartphone to capture someone breaking the law or behaving badly. In addition, using an action camera to record videos often doesn’t provide the same view you have because the camera is located somewhere other than your face.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/shop-all/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> have a great camera in them. They can also replace your earbuds if you like to walk and listen to music or audiobooks or have your messages read to you while you are doing something else like running. The glasses come in a variety of styles and will take prescription lenses.</p>\n<p><video poster=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/meta-ray-ban-poster.jpg\" controls=\"controls\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><source src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/031524_Sky_Mega-Mix_Multi-Feature_Mega-Mix-AI-30_16x9_Master_HD_H264.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses (Video Credit: Meta)</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>The camera is well hidden, so you don’t have the concerns that the old Google Glass headset had. While the base prices currently range from $299 to $379, these glasses could be just what your loved one needs to capture that fleeting moment when something truly good or terribly bad is happening and you want to create a permanent record.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>I hope this list helps you with your holiday shopping choices. Putting it together helped me make some of my own this year. I hope you have a marvelous holiday season!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Hightail All-Electric Dirt Bike by Dust Moto</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Dust-Hightail.jpg\" alt=\"Hightail all-electric dirt bike by Dust Moto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Dust-Hightail.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Dust-Hightail-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Dust-Hightail-768x360.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Hightail all-electric dirt bike (Image Credit: Dust Moto)</p>\n<p>While I don’t ride much anymore, I used to own a Suzuki 125 and a Yamaha 175. The 125 was my school motorcycle, and the 175 was offroad. The problem with gas bikes when you are riding in the wilderness is that they make a lot of noise, and they need RPMs for torque. This means you miss a lot of the natural sounds, and when you get into trouble, like on a steep hill, you can end up spinning your wheel while trying to build enough torque to climb it.</p>\n<p>At an estimated $10,950 and with a release date of late 2025, the Dust Moto’s <a href=\"https://www.dustmoto.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hightail all-electric dirt bike</a> is simply awesome. While not street legal, at least not yet, it is a monster of an alternative when it comes to riding off-road. It has an extremely clean design, and it was created by guys who also enjoy riding outdoors — we have a lot of that here in Oregon. Their experience shows in the design and execution of this bike.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dust Moto | Introducing The Hightail\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPeNwPYweYc\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>With 42 HP and 660 Nm of torque, it will run for up to two hours on a charge. Plus, it has a replaceable battery, so you could carry a spare. It was created with support from Bloom, a company specializing in electric motorcycles, so even though this is Dust Moto’s first bike, it isn’t Bloom’s first, so you can be confident this bike will do all it claims and more.</p>\n<p>Designed within walking distance of me, this would be on my Christmas shortlist for 2025 if I were still riding. As a result, the Hightail all-electric dirt bike by Dust Moto is my last Product of the Week for 2024, even though it won’t be on my Christmas list until 2025, when this bike will be available.</p>\n\n",

      },
      "content": "<p>Retail mobile apps have become indispensable to consumers, transforming how they shop. While mobile apps still capture significant attention, all-in-one web services in mobile wallets are emerging as an essential complement to individual mobile apps.</p>\n<p>Alex Campbell, CIO and co-founder of the mobile marketing platform <a href=\"https://www.vibes.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vibes</a>, notes that mobile wallets can drive app downloads for users hesitant to install full-featured apps. They present a substantial marketing opportunity through Apple and Google wallets integrated into iOS and Android devices.</p>\n<p>“It was once thought of as facilitating mobile payments or storing event tickets. But marketers have come to see it as a true engagement channel that unites the physical and digital worlds,” he told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>Other research suggests that mobile apps don’t necessarily need a complementary role. A study published in April by custom mobile app developer <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bryj.ai\">Bryj</a> highlighted strong consumer demand for companies to update their apps rather than phase them out.</p>\n<h3>Competitive Mobile App Marketplace</h3>\n<p>The Bryj survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers revealed that the rise of mobile apps has revolutionized how companies engage with customers, providing convenient access to products, services, and information anytime, anywhere. However, researchers said businesses must prioritize user experience, personalization, interface design, and security to avoid customers deleting apps lacking those features.</p>\n<p>Numerous mobile apps are available, and competition is heating up for coveted home screen space. So, companies that do not modernize their customer contact strategies could struggle with sustained retail app use, customer retention, and sales goals.</p>\n<p>“Whether through uniquely tailored recommendations or customized privacy settings, this level of customization enhances user engagement and fosters a deeper sense of connection and loyalty to the brand,” Lawrence Snapp, CEO of Bryj, told The E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>“Companies that leverage data-driven insights to deliver hyper-personalized experiences gain a significant competitive edge in today’s highly competitive market,” he observed about what will keep retail mobile apps at shoppers’ fingertips.</p>\n<h3>Adapting Retail Apps for AI and User Expectations</h3>\n<p>Consumers now rely on mobile apps for shopping, work, entertainment, and communication, expecting flawless user experiences.</p>\n<p>To stay relevant, businesses should consider integrating AI into their mobile apps, with a recent study showing that nearly three-quarters (72%) of Gen Z and millennials are open to AI-driven features.</p>\n<p>“To remain competitive, mobile apps must reflect the latest trends and technologies, like AI integration and enhanced user interfaces. This ensures companies provide exceptional experiences and meet consumers’ evolving needs and expectations,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, the appeal of modernized mobile apps may be waning. A Vibes study released in February revealed that digital wallets, which store loyalty cards, tickets, boarding passes, gift cards, and more, are increasingly replacing individual brand apps.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The research also found that 54% of consumers aged 25 to 54 currently use or plan to use mobile wallets for storing items like digital offers and loyalty cards.</p>\n<p>Bryj’s survey found that 62% of respondents, especially younger generations, have 10 to 30 mobile apps on each of their devices. Nearly a quarter (20%) of younger generations download about one app per week.</p>\n<p>Consumers seek apps that save them time and offer simplicity. The margin was close between those who listed time savings as their number one consideration when downloading an app (68%) and those who sought to simplify their lives as the second top consideration (65%).</p>\n<p>The Bryj survey also reveals the majority of consumers (64%) are more likely to use a business’s mobile app than its website through a mobile browser.</p>\n<h3>Attraction of Mobile Wallets</h3>\n<p>Mobile wallets bridge the engagement gap as persistent, contactless engagement channels that help unite the physical and digital worlds for marketing, commerce, service, and loyalty without app downloads. These features provide brands with two distinct advantages over traditional mobile apps.</p>\n<p>Retailers can easily update mobile wallet pass content and send timely, relevant wallet notifications to a user’s lock screen. This capability gives them a robust channel for continuous engagement with their customers. It drives those customers into stores to redeem coupons, offers, and points.</p>\n<p>According to Vibes, 75% of consumers said that text messages routinely drive them to purchase from brands. Sixty percent of respondents have used a mobile wallet-stored loyalty card when making an on-site purchase. A bit more than half (54%) said they had made an on-site purchase when a brand made an offer available via a mobile wallet.</p>\n<p>Campbell noted that digital wallets play a crucial complementary role by allowing consumers to store and access shopping essentials — like coupons, loyalty cards, tickets, and gift cards — in one place. Their ability to dynamically update in real time helps brands address a key challenge: encouraging customers to download and consistently use their mobile apps.</p>\n<p>“It is what we call a ‘low-reach, high-engagement’ channel. It is fantastic when a loyal customer downloads your app, but most won’t. Mobile wallets bridge the gap between high-reach, low-engagement email marketing, and low-reach, high-engagement mobile app marketing,” Snapp offered.</p>\n<h3>Mobile Wallets and SMS as Promo Tools</h3>\n<p>The shift to mobile wallets is driven by the fact that mobile wallets are becoming a bigger part of consumers’ lives. Additionally, Campbell observed that both Apple and Google are developing and promoting mobile payment wallets.</p>\n<p>He explained that it is a “combination of consumer demand and an awakening of marketers to the limitations presented by both email and mobile apps, as well as to just how easily Mobile Wallet integrates with their SMS marketing.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>For example, brands can boost revenue by using SMS combined with mobile wallets to drive foot traffic to retail stores and restaurants. A brand might send a text with a link to a $3 mobile wallet coupon, double loyalty points, or similar promotional offers.</p>\n<p>This strategy allows brands to track each downloaded pass and measure the success of SMS/wallet campaigns with clear attribution.</p>\n<h3>AI’s Role in Shaping the Future of Mobile Apps</h3>\n<p>AI is significantly impacting the mobile app industry and will continue introducing new tools, making it more accessible to consumers, noted Bryj’s Snapp. As technology advances, consumers now expect innovative features like AI.</p>\n<p>“Our recent consumer survey on mobile apps found nearly three-in-four Gen Z and millennials are open to those features,” he offered.</p>\n<p>Snapp added that AI-driven features like chatbots, virtual assistants, and predictive analytics can transform the user experience by making it more personalized, intuitive, and efficient.</p>\n<p>For instance, personalization within mobile apps is no longer a luxury but an expectation. Customers now expect experiences tailored to their specific preferences and requirements.</p>\n<p>Snapp noted that the digital native generation is transforming the mobile experience as we know it. This shift makes it even more competitive for mobile apps to win a prominent spot on shoppers’ phone screens.</p>\n<p>“As younger generations continue to view mobile apps as indispensable, we will find continued growth within the industry,” Snapp said.</p>\n<p>Bryj’s survey noted that poor user experiences, such as software bugs and slow loading time, are the main reasons consumers delete mobile apps on their devices. Other reasons are poor user interface and poor security features.</p>\n<p>“This is important to note as many retailers are vying for consumer attention and engagement in-app. Additionally, consumers are most interested in the ability to customize privacy and security settings within mobile apps,” disclosed Snapp.</p>\n<p>He concluded that to compete in this increasingly crowded market, retailers must invest now in delivering top-notch experiences and personalized touchpoints at every point in the buying journey.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The field of database administration is far from glamorous. Even within the uncompromisingly geeky domain of information technology, database administration would be among the last fields picked for a game of proverbial kickball.</p>\n<p>However, the future employment landscape for tech jobs remains uncertain in these changing times. Despite its somewhat unglamorous reputation, database management and administration is an industry experiencing rapid growth, persistent talent shortages, and significant changes brought by AI. This field has much potential for those willing to cash in on its viable career path.</p>\n<p>These watershed moments invariably present significant opportunities as well as challenges. <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com\">Percona</a>, an open-source database software, support, and services firm, optimizes how databases and applications run. Dave Stokes, a technology evangelist and database veteran at the company, is passionate about helping today’s aspiring database administrators (DBAs) find their way.</p>\n<p>Stokes has decades of experience in the DBA field. He often speaks on a wide range of cutting-edge topics regarding database operations. With his finger on the IT pulse, he offers the knowledge and expertise needed to mentor effectively.</p>\n<h3>Reshaping the Business World’s Database Needs</h3>\n<p>Perusing any industry report on the role of DBA in 2024 confirms that emerging trends and data solutions make for an ever-changing IT landscape. Today’s data environment generates more than two quintillion bytes of data per day.</p>\n<p>Demands for higher-quality data and real-time results push various database platforms to their limits. As a result, DBAs require increasingly sophisticated skill diversification.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is only one factor. Other challenges include managing on-premises operations and handling cloud migration and security. Evolution, adaptation, and innovation define DBA’s morphing trends.</p>\n<p>Open-source databases are now more popular than their commercial counterparts. More organizations are dependent on PostgreSQL and MySQL, according to Stokes.</p>\n<p>“This standardization on the choice of databases provides DBAs with more employment opportunities and gives employers a vast talent pool from which to fish,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Insider’s View of the World of Database Administration</h3>\n<p>We spoke with Stokes extensively about his view of the state of database management. He observed that the traditional DBA is virtually nonexistent “in the wild” today.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179314\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179314\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Dave-Stokes.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Stokes\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Dave-Stokes.jpg 200w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Dave-Stokes-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-179314\"><span>Dave Stokes<br>\nPercona Tech Evangelist</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A significant portion of conventional work has been moved to site reliability engineers or cloud providers’ services. As databases have mushroomed in size and scope, some functions, such as query optimization, have been ignored.</p>\n<p>“Much of what was handled by a DBA is now compensated for by purchasing ever larger cloud chunks,” Stokes told TechNewsWorld. “Institutional knowledge about an organization’s data was abandoned when the DBA role was supplanted.”</p>\n<p>Until that impact escalates, trying to figure out how some data is structured and how it impacts ongoing operations is a tertiary consideration, he observed.</p>\n<p>But there is good news about where DBA is headed. Some data workers are interested in the functions performed by a DBA, even if they do not have that title.</p>\n<p>“Query tuning, defining data structures, server optimization, and administration of the instance itself have value,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Demystifying DBA Dilemmas: Q&amp;A</h3>\n<p>Dave Stokes shared more insights on the latest trends, technologies, and challenges in the field of database administration. From the impact of cutting-edge technologies to the evolving role of DBAs, Stokes offered valuable perspectives on navigating the complex landscape of database management.</p>\n<h4>TechNewsWord: What cutting-edge database technology is impacting this field?</h4>\n<p><strong>Dave Stokes:</strong> Vector data for machine learning will consume unprecedented amounts of disk space, processor cycles, and administrative time. Moving a copy of a model to another location for training will incur expensive transfer fees, require monitoring, and take up even more disk space.</p>\n<p>JSON is the data interchange of choice for most. Storing data in a JSON format is not as efficient as storing it in traditional data types. Extracting some JSON values and storing them as a traditional data type can speed processing but add complexity.</p>\n<p>Replicated data over several data centers is very common. Managing that data, spread out over a continent or globe, is tricky.</p>\n<h4>How are changing business and industry trends affecting database administration?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> The ability to add more processing power or disk space by clicking a checkbox on a webpage and paying for it with a credit card has revolutionized data administration. There is no more worrying about getting approval for a capital expenditure, capacity planning, or sweating the optimizations needed.</p>\n<p>Lead time for expansion is now nonexistent. When a company may have had a dozen databases at the beginning of this century, they now can have tens of thousands of them.</p>\n<p>Need to expand into AI? Then load billions of records into a cloud account and worry about the quality and quantity later. And as data lakes creep into data oceans, the data still needs to be managed, backed up, and monitored.</p>\n<h4>How will automation and AI impact changes in DBA?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> AI is needed in the database itself. However, general AI adoption by an organization means more disk space, processor cores, data migrations, and backups.</p>\n<p>An optimizer that can spot data usage patterns and recognize the need to cache specific data or autotune buffer usage would be a big plus. Smarter query optimizations and user usage patterns could shift server capacities to accommodate data needs.</p>\n<h4>How is the shift in DBA from on-site to the cloud impacting business, or is it vice-versa?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Those who could move their data to the cloud have found a big benefit in many cases. Scaling is now a function of using a credit card. Backups, server failovers, and software upgrades are handled by the cloud vendor.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>For many, the need for an in-house DBA has been replaced by a dependency on their cloud provider. Some have found the cloud too expensive and have returned to on-premises operations. In these cases, they need to have staff to handle the traditional work of a DBA.</p>\n<h4>What role is cloud migration now playing in the cost and efficiency of DB operations?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Costs are steadily increasing. Businesses used to be reluctant to spend money on capital expenditures, and upgrading servers was a complicated process, often taking months.</p>\n<p>In the cloud, upgrades are an operational budget expense done on a credit card almost instantaneously. Why optimize data or a server when itemizing a bill is easier and faster?</p>\n<h4>Why is DBA still a relevant job in 2024?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Although the title may not say DBA, someone will always be needed to monitor, tune, optimize, and guide database instances. These may be seen as hygiene factors, but the reliability of the data requires them.</p>\n<h4>How can young professionals find success in this industry?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Learn Structured Query Language (SQL). There is a reason why it is the only computer language that survived from the 1970s. It matches business logic exceptionally well and is designed to deliver the information requested in a way it can be used.</p>\n<p>Data normalization is also critical. Poorly defined data structures are slow and become challenging to manage over time.</p>\n<p>Lastly, communication is key. The ability to express why a change to a table that seems simple to a requester can shut down a petabyte of information for hours can save an organization from disaster.</p>\n<h4>Where do you see DBA and its needs headed?</h4>\n<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Better data backup and faster data restoration are always needed. Much attention is paid to the time and financial costs of recovering data, and there will be a push to reduce these costs.</p>\n<p>Security enhancements will be pursued. It is still too easy to have a minor slip-up, either in the cloud or on-premises, that leads to finding your data on the front page of a newspaper.</p>\n<p>DBAs will need better tools to handle the explosive growth in the scope and scale of the instances they manage.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Making better use of educational technology is a goal that both software and hardware companies are aggressively pursuing.</p>\n<p>Keeping students engaged in today’s distraction-filled world is no easy feat. Teachers often have to contend with competing gadgets like tablets and smartphones distracting students from group instruction.</p>\n<p>However, when used correctly, technology such as smartboards and AI-powered presentation devices reshape learning and create positive learning environments for students.</p>\n<p>The trick is to grab their attention and keep them engaged. Many companies are dedicated to creating and selling solutions that accomplish those tasks.</p>\n<p>According to Maryam Hassani, acting head of trends and innovation at the Abu Dhabi Early Childhood Authority (ECA), reports show the global EdTech market is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 12.9% by 2032. In 2022, North America led this charge with a 36% revenue share.</p>\n<p>“This surge in EdTech is reshaping learning journeys, offering innovative solutions to challenges like sparking curiosity in STEM [science, technology, engineering, and math] fields and providing tailored lessons for children with special needs,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Early and special education students are not the only beneficiaries of innovative teaching technology. The rapid technological revolution is transforming nearly every aspect of our lives, and education on all levels is no exception. Tech ed tools with AI features increasingly help educators make complex concepts easier to grasp and more relatable at all instructional levels.</p>\n<h3>EdTech Driving Latest Learning Trends</h3>\n<p>EdTech is continually evolving, with some exciting trends emerging, offered JQ Sirls, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.storytailor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Storytailor</a>, whose product personalizes content to fit students’ unique experiences.</p>\n<p>“Personalized learning through AI is making education more tailored to individual needs,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/diagnosus-app-uses-gamification-to-fill-gaps-in-medical-education-178676.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gamification</a> turns learning into an engaging experience. A growing focus on inclusivity and accessibility ensures modern learning tools are available to all students, regardless of their background or abilities.</p>\n<p>“These trends are reshaping how we approach education, making it more dynamic and inclusive,” Sirls added.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smarttech.com/en/education \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart Technologies</a> is a prime example of how computer-based methodologies make ed tech more effective. This company pioneers learning solutions that enable educators worldwide to build connections that matter using a full range of products.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>To be more effective, schools must approach the process of adopting innovative technology more thoughtfully. It is a two-step process that first identifies the needed software tools. It only then seeks the ideal hardware to make it accessible in classrooms, according to Jeff Lowe, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Smart Technologies.</p>\n<p>“The formula is quite simple. You start with teaching and learning practices, and then the next step is to look at software. See what software aligns with the desired outcome and can help enable those teaching and learning practices,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Three key factors are involved in making this work, he added. His company’s product developers discuss with client schools the need to choose the right ed tech tools for students, identify their specific needs, and select tools that align with curriculum goals.</p>\n<p>“The state of EdTech is not that efficient, or ripe, with results because this formula is often not adhered to. It is looked at in the opposite direction. We are a hardware company with hardware and software, so we are part of this equation as well,” cautioned Lowe.</p>\n<h3>Putting EdTech to Better Use Takes Practice, Training</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, schools adopt the latest and greatest piece of tech without a clear idea of what teachers and students will do with it or how it maps to the teaching and learning practices, according to Lowe. It is often a haphazard hardware-first decision. School admins must decide how it will be applied and what software will run on it.</p>\n<p>The last step in the tech onboarding process is training and professional development. Training should focus on how the technology supports teaching and learning practices, not just how to use the tech.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody realizes the importance of training, but often the training is around the tech,” he added. “Instead, it needs to focus on the desired outcome for the student and teacher and how the technology makes that better, which is a different type of training.”</p>\n<p>Lowe noted that Smart Technologies’ products are mainly trained by teachers for teachers. The company has a large staff of current and former educators, which results in a wide range of skills in technology adoption that help customers.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The challenge lies in scaling that insight. Training cannot be effective if only presented as a one-and-done professional day event. Lowe warned that this is a barrier to success.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time, it is more of a teach-the-teacher approach, where you get real advocates within a school or an academic department that get trained very deeply, maybe by us, then take it as their mission to train a number of the other teachers within a school,” he said.</p>\n<p>Scaling the training is the key to success, according to Lowe. School officials must roll this out to include the principal level and the tech directors within the school.</p>\n<p>“So, all of that needs to be coordinated. But if you do not think through that process, you are not going to get the full benefit. Otherwise, it just becomes a crowded space, and there is more pressure on teachers, on their time, not just with new technology, but with everything else that is going on in their lives,” Lowe suggested.</p>\n<h3>Ensuring EdTech Success and Adoption</h3>\n<p>That is the real nut schools need to crack. Smart Technologies helps achieve that goal with its ambassador program. The company’s products are used globally, so thousands of teachers worldwide are part of an online community the company sponsors to help each other.</p>\n<p>Teachers can post questions, and everybody using the various software programs and hardware tools provides a mutual aid society. According to Lowe, community-level experts worldwide who support each other in different languages have been very effective. Not just with training but also with best practices for using the technology and building websites with self-paced learning.</p>\n<p>The usefulness is not something to gloss over. It is critical for success.</p>\n<p>“Once an educator can see that this is not different from what he or she is doing, using ed tech does not become another add-on to the endless list of things teachers are expected to do,” Lowe said.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Attempts to protect children’s safety in the two-dimensional realm of online social media could adversely impact the 3D world of augmented and virtual reality, according to a report released Tuesday by a Washington, D.C., technology think tank.</p>\n<p>Legislative efforts, like the Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act (KOPSA), which has passed the U.S. Senate and is now before the House of Representatives, could lead to harmful censorship of AR/VR content, maintained the report by the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itif.org/\">Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation</a>.</p>\n<p>If KOPSA becomes law, AR/VR platforms may be forced to ramp up enforcement in the same manner as traditional social media platforms, the report explained.</p>\n<p>By giving the FTC authority to deem content on these platforms harmful, it continued, the FTC may over-censor content on AR/VR platforms, or the platforms themselves may censor content to avoid liability, which could include content pertinent to children’s education, entertainment, and identity.</p>\n<p>“One of our fears that we have with KOPSA is that it opens the door for potential over-censorship by giving the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] power to decide what qualifies as harmful,” said the report’s author, Policy Analyst Alex Ambrose.</p>\n<p>“It’s another way for a political party to decide what’s harmful,” she told TechNewsWorld. “The FTC could say content like environmental protection, global warming, and climate change is anxiety-inducing. So we need to completely get rid of anything related to climate change because it could lead to anxiety in children.”</p>\n<h3>Over-Censorship Can Be Avoided</h3>\n<p>Andy Lulham, COO of <a href=\"https://verifymy.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifyMy</a>, an age and content verification provider based in London, acknowledged that the specter of over-censorship looms large in discussions about online regulation. “But I firmly believe this fear, while understandable, is largely misplaced,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Well-crafted government regulations are not the enemy of free expression, but rather its guardian in the digital age.”</p>\n<p>Lulham maintained that the key to regulation lies in the approach. “Blanket, heavy-handed regulations risk tipping the scales towards over-censorship,” he said. “However, I envision a more nuanced, principle-based regulatory framework that can enhance online freedom while protecting vulnerable users. We’ve seen examples of such balanced approaches in privacy regulations like GDPR.”</p>\n<p>The GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation — which has been in effect since 2018, is a comprehensive data protection law in the European Union that regulates how companies collect, store, and use the personal data of EU residents.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“I strongly believe that regulations should focus on mandating robust safety systems and processes rather than dictating specific content decisions,” Lulham continued. “This approach shifts the responsibility to platforms to develop comprehensive trust and safety strategies, fostering innovation rather than creating a culture of fear and over-removal.”</p>\n<p>He asserted that transparency will be the linchpin of effective regulation. “Mandating detailed transparency reports can hold platforms accountable without resorting to heavy-handed content policing,” he explained. “This not only helps prevent overreach but also builds public trust in both the platforms and the regulatory framework.”</p>\n<p>“Furthermore,” he added, “I advocate for regulations requiring clear, accessible appeal processes for content removal decisions. This safety valve can help correct inevitable mistakes and prevent unwarranted censorship.”</p>\n<p>“Critics might argue that any regulation will inevitably lead to some censorship,” Lulham conceded. “However, I contend that the greater threat to free expression comes from unregulated spaces where vulnerable users are silenced by abuse and harassment. Well-designed regulations can create a more level playing field, amplifying diverse voices that might otherwise be drowned out.”</p>\n<h3>Good, Bad, and Ugly of AR/VR</h3>\n<p>The ITIF report noted that conversations about online safety often overlook AR/VR technologies. Immersive technologies foster social connection and stimulate creativity and imagination, it explained. Play, imagination, and creativity are all imperative for children to develop.</p>\n<p>The report acknowledged, however, that properly addressing the risks children face with immersive technologies is a challenge. Most existing immersive technologies are not made for children under 13, it continued. Children explore adult-designed spaces, which leads to exposure to age-inappropriate content and can build harmful habits and behaviors in children’s mental and social development.</p>\n<p>Addressing these risks will require a combination of market innovation and thoughtful policymaking, it added. Companies’ design decisions, content moderation practices, parental control tools, and trust and safety strategies will largely shape the safety environment in the metaverse.</p>\n<p>It conceded, however, that public policy interventions are necessary to tackle certain safety threats. Policymakers are already addressing children’s safety on “2D” platforms such as social media, leading to regulations that may affect AR/VR tech, ITIF noted.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Before enacting those regulations, the report recommended policymakers consider AR/VR developers’ ongoing safety efforts and ensure that these tools maintain their effectiveness. When safety tools are insufficient, it continued, policymakers should focus on targeted interventions to address proven harms, not hypothetical risks.</p>\n<p>“Most online services are working to remove harmful content, but the sheer amount of that content online means that some of it will inevitably slip through the cracks,” Ambrose said. “The issues we see in platforms today, like the incitement of violence, vandalism, and spreading harmful content and misinformation, will only continue on immersive platforms.”</p>\n<p>“The metaverse is going to thrive on massive amounts of data, so we can assume that these issues will be pervasive — maybe even more pervasive than what we see today,” she added.</p>\n<h3>Safety by Design</h3>\n<p>Lulham agreed with the report’s contention that companies’ design decisions will shape the safety environment of the metaverse.</p>\n<p>“In my view, the decisions companies make regarding online safety will be pivotal in creating a secure digital environment for children,” he said. “The current landscape is fraught with risks, and I believe companies have both the responsibility and power to reshape it.”</p>\n<p>He maintained that user interface design is the first line of defense to protect kids. “Companies prioritizing intuitive, age-appropriate designs can fundamentally alter how children interact with online platforms,” he explained. “By crafting interfaces that naturally guide users towards and educate them on safer behaviors, we can significantly reduce harmful encounters.”</p>\n<p>Content moderation is at a critical juncture, he added. “The volume of content demands a paradigm shift in our approach,” he observed. “While AI-powered tools are essential, they’re not a panacea. I argue that the future lies in a hybrid approach, combining advanced AI with human oversight to navigate the fine line between protection and censorship.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Parental control tools are often overlooked but crucial, he maintained. These shouldn’t be mere add-ons but core features designed with the same attention as the main platform. “I envision a future where these tools are so intuitive and effective that they become integral to family digital life,” he said.</p>\n<p>He contended that trust and safety strategies will differentiate thriving platforms from faltering ones. “Companies adopting a holistic approach, integrating robust age verification, real-time monitoring, and transparent reporting, will set the gold standard,” he declared. “Regular engagement with child safety experts and policymakers will be non-negotiable for companies serious about protecting young users.”</p>\n<p>“In essence,” he continued, “I see the future of online safety for children as one where ‘safety by design’ isn’t just a buzzword but the fundamental principle driving all aspects of platform development.”</p>\n<p>The report noted that children, as drivers of the metaverse, play a crucial role in the market adoption of immersive technologies.</p>\n<p>Ensuring innovation can flourish in this nascent field while also creating a safe environment for all users of AR/VR technology will be a complex challenge, it acknowledged, adding that parents, corporations, and regulators all have roles to play by balancing privacy and safety concerns while creating engaging and innovative immersive experiences.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Qualcomm unveiled a new Snapdragon chip on Tuesday, designed to give entry-level mobile phones more muscle and 5G connectivity.</p>\n<p>The Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 platform promises all-day battery life, improved camera capabilities, and 1 Gbps peak 5G speeds — seven times faster than LTE platforms in the same price tier.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm stated the mobile platform will make 5G accessible to 2.8 billion smartphone users in select regions around the world, and added it will be initially adopted by key OEMs, including Xiaomi, with the first units being available before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>“The Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 Mobile Platform is a significant leap forward in making 5G technology more accessible, so more people can navigate the world at 5G speeds,” Qualcomm Senior Vice President and General Manager of Mobile Handsets Chris Patrick said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“They are really opening up the $99 smartphone class with big improvements for a group that typically gets bottom-of-the-barrel performance,” declared Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.</p>\n<p>“Entry-level phones in this class appear to be getting the most substantial boost in years,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Rewards for All Stakeholders</h3>\n<p>The chip has benefits for consumers, carriers, and phone makers, Enderle continued. “Consumers get an increase in performance and battery life — around 1.5 hours of video streaming and 30 minutes more talk time over the prior generation — significant improvements in image quality — images and videos will look a lot better on big TV screens — and a significant improvement in game performance,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Carriers get a stronger argument to get users to upgrade to 5G — better modem performance,” he added, “and phone makers get a stronger argument to get people to upgrade their phones to the newer technology.”</p>\n<p>Phone makers can also benefit from the platform’s versatility and cost-effectiveness, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas. “It allows them to design a wide range of devices that cater to various market segments without compromising quality,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Carriers also gain from the enhanced 5G capabilities, which facilitate more reliable and faster network performance, ultimately improving user experience and driving the adoption of next-generation mobile services,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Regional Appeal</h3>\n<p>Geography will play a significant role in the distribution of devices built on the chip, according to tech experts.</p>\n<p>“The 4-series is Qualcomm’s entry-level cellular chipset. It is really aimed at economies and geographies where a lot of the installed base is still on LTE,” explained Ross Rubin, principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“With this Snapdragon 4s Gen 2, the idea is to entice those who are using LTE to make the jump to 5G,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Some of that is going to depend upon what the carrier rates look like for 5G service versus 4G service in those geographies.”</p>\n<p>“This could definitely be a chipset relevant for markets like China and India,” added John Strand of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://strandconsult.dk\">Strand Consult</a>, a Danish telecom consulting firm.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“This is a chipset that is very interesting for phone manufacturers supplying the Indian and Chinese markets. That’s where you will see the highest volume of this chipset. That’s their target group,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Phil Solis, research director for connectivity and smartphone semiconductors at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>, a global technology market research company, explained that the introduction of more entry-level 5G system-on-a-chip (SoC) chips will lead to more 5G smartphones at lower price points. “This will disproportionately affect regions with lower average smartphone selling prices, such as Eastern Europe, India, and Latin America,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“India is an important market because it is transitioning to 5G, because of the size of its population, and because of the increasing size of its middle class,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Spurring 5G Penetration</h3>\n<p>Solis noted that only 70% of smartphones shipped this year will support 5G. “This Qualcomm platform will help accelerate the growth of this percentage over the next few years,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to IDC, global 5G penetration is expected to cross 67% by the end of 2024 and 81% by the end of 2028. Currently, 5G penetration in developed regions is 88% — 90% in China — while in developing regions, it’s 41%.</p>\n<p>Vena predicted that the new Snapdragon platform’s impact should be profound. “It’s set to significantly accelerate 5G adoption by making advanced 5G connectivity more accessible to a broader range of consumers.”</p>\n<p>“By integrating robust 5G capabilities into mid-tier and budget-friendly devices, Qualcomm enables a wider audience to experience the benefits of faster internet speeds, lower latency, and improved network reliability,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“This democratization of 5G technology not only enhances user experiences across various applications, from streaming and gaming to telehealth and remote work, but also incentivizes carriers to expand their 5G infrastructure,” Vena said. “Consequently, the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 serves as a catalyst for widespread 5G deployment, driving greater market penetration and fostering innovation across the mobile ecosystem.”</p>\n<h3>Protecting Revenue Share</h3>\n<p>Rubin pointed out that Qualcomm isn’t alone in producing 5G chips for the low-priced end of the market.</p>\n<p>“There are other options for inexpensive 5G chips, primarily from <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/does-mediatek-have-an-identity-crisis-179195.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MediaTek</a>,” he said. Historically, they have been the dominant provider in the more price-sensitive end of the market. They’re not necessarily the absolute cheapest phones, but they’ve provided chips for a lot of the mainstream devices outside of the U.S.”</p>\n<p>The real significance of this SoC is that it is part of Qualcomm’s strategy to better compete with MediaTek in phones with lower prices, added Solis. “MediaTek is starting to gain share in premium and flagship phones,” he explained. “Most of the revenue for smartphone SoCs is in higher-end SoCs.”</p>\n<p>“India is a key country for SoC vendors to focus on,” he continued. “By focusing on India’s growing 5G SoC market, Qualcomm is trying to position itself in a market with a huge population and a growing middle class that will increasingly shift to purchasing higher-end phones.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“Qualcomm is positioning itself for shipment share growth there now, which will translate into revenue share growth in the long term,” he said.</p>\n<p>Solis noted that in 2023, MediaTek had 29% of mobile phone SoC shipments, while Qualcomm had 20%. On the revenue side, however, Qualcomm garnered 35%, compared to MediaTek’s 22%.</p>\n<p>“MediaTek leads in global mobile phone SoC shipments, but Qualcomm leads in mobile phone SoC revenue,” he explained. “MediaTek is looking to grow its revenue share, and Qualcomm is looking to protect it.”</p>\n<p>Competition considerations aside, for Qualcomm followers, the arrival of the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 is the end of a long wait. “This is a long time coming from Qualcomm,” said Anshel Sag, a senior analyst for mobility, 5G, and XR at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>“They’ve long promised that 5G would eventually reach an affordable price point,” he continued. “It is great to see the 5G features trickling down from the high-end, and I believe that having this many affordable devices in the market over the next few years will juice operators’ motivation for deploying standalone 5G.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Workplace safety is an increasing concern in modern environments. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are driving innovative hardware solutions to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Managing any facility or organizational team now involves greater responsibility for safety, whether in workplaces, campuses, hospitals, or other settings. These challenges are driving demand for safer, opt-in hardware solutions.</p>\n<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently expressed support for this technology, stating the “integration of AI in workplace safety heralds a transformative era for occupational health.” <a href=\"https://alcatraz.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alcatraz AI</a> has taken the lead in providing frictionless, AI-powered biometric access control solutions that are revolutionizing security through facial authentication.</p>\n<p>These solutions establish a new standard for access control, replacing outdated methods by allowing workers to use their faces as credentials. Only those who opt-in for facial authentication gain access, strengthening building security.</p>\n<p>The Facial-Authentication-as-a-Service (FaaS) company recently unveiled its flagship product, Rock X (shown above), in April at the International Security and Conference Exposition (ISC West 2024). This advanced AI-powered system redefines outdoor security, offering high-performance facial authentication in all lighting and weather conditions.</p>\n<p>“Getting people to use biometrics, use it consistently, and have a great experience has always been very challenging. That is why there has not been lots of adoption until recently,” Blaine Frederick, VP of product at Alcatraz AI, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Flexible Facial Recognition Integration Simplifies Deployment</h3>\n<p>The benefit of facial recognition devices is that the company can attach them to any access control or video management head-end already in use.</p>\n<p>For example, a company with dozens of card readers throughout their facility can hang the units on the wall either right above them or remove them, tap into the existing cabling infrastructure, and commission it.</p>\n<p>“You are good to go. You do not need to rip out any existing panels or access control,” said Frederick.</p>\n<p>The video feeds will flow directly into any of the virtual machine systems or video management systems, providing an eye-level view of people coming and going. This approach reduces installation costs.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>After installation, ongoing costs vary depending on the subscription plan selected. The options include on-premises and in-cloud.</p>\n<p>For some customers, the company hosts the recognition software in its cloud, either in a single-tenant or a multi-tenant environment, all in AWS. Other customers prefer the platform software housed on their servers behind their firewalls.</p>\n<p>“Some companies are a little ahead on cloud computing and would rather not have to handle the maintenance and deal with the servers and infrastructure. So, we are completely flexible how you choose to deploy the systems,” Frederick remarked.</p>\n<h3>AI Overcomes Outdated Biometric Methods</h3>\n<p>Biometrics technology — facial and fingerprint recognition — has been around for a while. However, the equipment used was often underpowered by antiquated methodology. Companies enrolled their workers with more traditional old-school face biometrics.</p>\n<p>“You enroll a person, and it creates a bit string that is saved in memory. Each time the person appears, the system compares the stored bit string to the new one to determine if it matches,” Frederick explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>People’s appearances change over time. However, static templates do not change. Without regular updates from IT or HR, systems gradually become less reliable and harder to use,” he added.</p>\n<p>“AI processors and GPUs are now smaller and exist on the edge. We can use these modern techniques now to solve these older problems. Our device has a GPU built into it, and all of the AI/ML processing happens on the edge, providing redundancy, so you do not have to worry about the network and so forth,” noted Frederick.</p>\n<h3>Biometric Access Control Use Cases for Workplace Safety</h3>\n<p>This new technology improves the accuracy of on-site safety. For instance, the Alcatraz AI platform also detects tailgate entries, which is probably the number one security problem.</p>\n<p>According to Frederick, security directors acknowledge that tailgate entry is typically not malicious but rather a result of people being polite.</p>\n<p>“I swipe my badge; I go through the door and hold it open for the person behind me. Maybe that person is supposed to be there, maybe not,” he suggested.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The reality is there is a strong need for tools and technology that allow you to know whether or not a person is supposed to be there and then alert people in real time to make decisions. That is critical for ensuring security in a safe workplace.</p>\n<p>“Being able to verify that the right people are in the right places is super critical for lots of companies, whether or not it is a safety issue. A former employee comes into a place and is looking to cause harm to someone or execute a cyberattack. Many data breaches occur not because somebody hacked in from the outside, but rather somebody gained entrance into the building and physical access to a company’s infrastructure,” he observed.</p>\n<p>That necessity exists in a wide range of work environments. These include everyday offices, stadiums and arenas, college campuses, pharma and life sciences facilities, retail locations, and airports.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The growing use of artificial intelligence in the workplace is fueling a rapid increase in data consumption, challenging the corporate ability to safeguard sensitive data.</p>\n<p>A report released in May from data security firm <a href=\"https://www.cyberhaven.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cyberhaven</a>, titled “The Cubicle Culprits,” sheds light on AI adoption trends and their correlation to heightened risk. Cyberhaven’s analysis drew on a dataset of usage patterns from three million workers to assess AI adoption and its implications in the corporate environment.</p>\n<p>The rapid rise of AI mimics previous transformative shifts, such as the internet and cloud computing. Just as early cloud adopters navigated new challenges, today’s companies must contend with the complexities introduced by widespread AI adoption, according to Cyberhaven CEO Howard Ting.</p>\n<p>“Our research on AI usage and risks not only highlights the impact of these technologies but also underscores the emerging risks that could parallel those encountered during significant technological upheavals in the past,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Findings Suggest Alarm Over Potential for AI Abuses</h3>\n<p>The Cubicle Culprits report reveals the rapid acceleration of AI adoption in the workplace and use by end users that outpaces corporate IT. This trend, in turn, fuels risky “shadow AI” accounts, including more types of sensitive company data.</p>\n<p>Products from three AI tech giants — OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft — dominate AI usage. Their products account for 96% of AI usage at work.</p>\n<p>According to the research, workers worldwide entered sensitive corporate data into AI tools, increasing by an alarming 485% from March 2023 to March 2024. We are still early in the adoption curve. Only 4.7% of employees at financial firms, 2.8% in pharma and life sciences, and 0.6% at manufacturing firms use AI tools.</p>\n<p>A significant 73.8% of ChatGPT usage at work occurs through non-corporate accounts. Unlike enterprise versions, these accounts incorporate shared data into public models, posing a considerable risk to sensitive data security,” warned Ting.</p>\n<p>“A substantial portion of sensitive corporate data is being sent to non-corporate accounts. This includes roughly half of the source code [50.8%], research and development materials [55.3%], and HR and employee records [49.0%],” he said.</p>\n<p>Data shared through these non-corporate accounts are incorporated into public models. The percentage of non-corporate account usage is even higher for Gemini (94.4%) and Bard (95.9%).</p>\n<h3>AI Data Hemorrhaging Uncontrollably</h3>\n<p>This trend indicates a critical vulnerability. Ting said that non-corporate accounts lack the robust security measures to protect such data.</p>\n<p>AI adoption rates are rapidly reaching new departments and use cases involving sensitive data. Some 27% of data that employees put into AI tools is sensitive, up from 10.7% a year ago.</p>\n<p>For example, 82.8% of legal documents employees put into AI tools went to non-corporate accounts, potentially exposing the information publicly.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Ting cautioned that including patented material in content generated by AI tools poses increasing risks. Source code insertions generated by AI outside of coding tools can create the risk of vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Some companies are clueless about stopping the flow of unauthorized and sensitive data exported to AI tools beyond IT’s reach. They rely on existing data security tools that only scan the data’s content to identify its type.</p>\n<p>“What’s been missing is the context of where the data came from, who interacted with it, and where it was stored. Consider the example of an employee pasting code into a personal AI account to help debug it,” offered Ting. “Is it source code from a repository? Is it customer data from a SaaS application?”</p>\n<h3>Controlling Data Flow Is Possible</h3>\n<p>Educating workers about the data leakage problem is a viable part of the solution if done correctly, assured Ting. Most companies have rolled out periodic security awareness training.</p>\n<p>“However, the videos workers have to watch twice a year are soon forgotten. The education that works best is correcting bad behavior immediately in the moment,” he offered.</p>\n<p>Cyberhaven found that when workers receive a popup message coaching them during risky activities, like pasting source code into a personal ChatGPT account, ongoing bad behavior decreases by 90%,” said Ting.</p>\n<p>His company’s technology, Data Detection and Response (DDR) understands how data moves and uses that context to protect sensitive data. The technology also understands the difference between a corporate and personal account for ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>This capability enables companies to enforce a policy that blocks employees from pasting sensitive data into personal accounts while allowing that data to flow to enterprise accounts.</p>\n<h3>Surprising Twist in Who’s at Fault</h3>\n<p>Cyberhaven analyzed the prevalence of insider risks based on workplace arrangements, including remote, onsite, and hybrid. Researchers found that a worker’s location impacts the data spread when a security incident occurs.</p>\n<p>“Our research uncovered a surprising twist in the narrative. In-office employees, traditionally considered the safest bet, are now leading the charge in corporate data exfiltration,” he revealed.</p>\n<p>Counterintuitively, office-based workers are 77% more likely than their remote counterparts to exfiltrate sensitive data. However, when office-based workers log in from offsite, they are 510% more likely to exfiltrate data than when onsite, making this the riskiest time for corporate data, according to Ting.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>This is a “man bites dog” story because, for much of the two companies’ existence, Intel’s brand value ranked among the highest in the world, consistently outpacing that of AMD. Under the leadership of Intel’s then-CEO Andy Grove, its former CMO Dennis Carter significantly enhanced this value by creating constructs like the Bunny People and leveraging a generous marketing budget to generate remarkable interest in Intel products.</p>\n<p>However, like many C-level executives, Carter did a poor job of training his subordinates. The result is that after several decades, Intel’s massive brand advantage has eroded. In the latest <a href=\"https://indd.adobe.com/view/c21c3b44-92cb-4386-848e-c1641347979b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kantar Brandz report</a> listing the 100 most valuable companies, AMD came in 41st and Intel 48th. Apple was first, and Nvidia was sixth. Let’s talk about how this happened, what this means for AMD and Intel going forward, and why the underlying problem could be dangerous for the entire PC and server industry.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N electric SUV. For a fraction of the cost of expensive, high-performance cars or SUVs, it has impressively better performance and is more fun than a Tesla. It is likely the quickest fast hatch currently in the market.</p>\n<h3>Intel Inside: A Marketing Legacy</h3>\n<p>Intel Inside was a program my wife managed for some time and was one of Intel’s most powerful assets. You’d have a hard time naming another brand asset with anywhere near the name recognition that Intel once had.</p>\n<p>Most of us don’t know which companies made the processors in our appliances, electric cars, or EV engines, though we really should care who made the batteries, as they aren’t created equal. If asked, Tesla drivers may not even know who made their batteries, though Tesla uniquely disclosed that they came from Panasonic.</p>\n<p>This recognition didn’t happen overnight. It resulted from a massive effort undertaken by Dennis Carter during most of the 1990s. Other than Apple under Steve Jobs, most tech companies under-invest in marketing and too often hire engineers as CMOs who have no deep understanding of the job.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>That marketing support was an unbelievably powerful benefit to Intel because brand value relates to consideration. For instance, Apple’s enviable position as the number one brand refers directly to its market success. However, McDonald’s number five rating and current financial performance might be an exception to that rule.</p>\n<p>This reminds me of a story my grandfather told me when I was a kid. It was about the Wrigley company and its founder, William Wrigley Jr. He was on a steam engine-powered train back in the early 1900s. At the time, Wrigley was the top confection company in the industry. Wrigley had a young assistant with him who, like many new employees fresh out of school, thought his degree made him an expert.</p>\n<p>In an effort to show his intelligence, the employee asked Wrigley why he spent so much money on advertising, given he was already number one in the industry. Wrigley looked at him and asked, <em> Given this train is traveling around 60 mph, why don’t they stop putting coal in the engine?</em></p>\n<p>The point was that marketing isn’t just to attain leadership; it is also necessary to sustain it.</p>\n<h3>How AMD Moved Ahead of Intel</h3>\n<p>AMD is anything but a marketing powerhouse, but under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, the company has been extremely good at execution. Its products have been problem-free and have met or exceeded expectations. AMD has been making strategic acquisitions to close the competitive gap, not with Intel but with Nvidia and a focus on AI.</p>\n<p>AMD has traditionally not been a top brand, but its consistent execution has helped it maintain and grow its value over time. Intel’s brand value fell due to a lack of funding and a lack of focus on its unusual level of ingredient marketing.</p>\n<p>If you look at the Kantar report I linked above, except for Nvidia, which has become synonymous with AI, the first brand, like Intel, that is an ingredient brand is Qualcomm, valued in 40th place, which is almost tied with AMD at 41. Qualcomm has that lead because of Snapdragon and its recent marketing efforts to raise the visibility of its new PC offerings.</p>\n<p>One reason most of these brands rank in the 40s on that list is that <a href=\"https://www.vendavo.com/glossary/what-are-market-development-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">market development funds</a> (MDF) programs aren’t working right now.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>These programs were unique in providing money to OEMs to market products containing the parts from the vendor supplying the MDF funds. However, over time, the OEMs started using MDF to supplement margins and cut marketing with little or no pushback from the supplying vendors.</p>\n<p>This diversion of funds crippled the programs. Despite Intel investing more into these programs than any other vendor, the vendors aren’t spending the dollars as intended, resulting in minimal demand generation or consideration benefits for Intel. Instead, these funds have become redundant discounts for the vendors who receive them, leading to the programs failing across the board.</p>\n<p>In Intel’s defense, it is executing better and is at the heart of the effort to build up the U.S. chip manufacturing capabilities. Still, I think it needs to return to the kind of effort Dennis Carter made with the Intel Inside and Bunny People marketing campaigns to regain its once impressive brand glory.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: Technology’s Big Marketing Problem</h3>\n<p>Engineers tend to run tech companies and aren’t known for their people skills. Like sales, marketing is all about people skills but at scale.</p>\n<p>Windows 95 was the most aggressively marketed tech product in history, but it also showcased that Microsoft didn’t understand marketing. Even though the program was massively successful, it declined to repeat it because support couldn’t manage the resulting massive volume.</p>\n<p>The correct thing to have done would have been to fix support. Instead, it collapsed and eliminated the folks who drove the success of Windows 95. A few years later, it did the same thing with the group that pushed the Xbox success, which is partially why the Microsoft Zune and Phone were such failures.</p>\n<p>After Dennis Carter left Intel, subsequent CMOs destroyed the Bunny People and nearly eliminated the value of Intel Inside. They didn’t understand the need to protect and build the massive brand value that Intel once enjoyed. Every C-level executive should be an expert in their field, not a transplanted engineer who is treading water.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> I think the whole tech industry is learning this the hard way. Dell recently improved to 81st place in the Kantar Brandz report. Lenovo, HP, and HPE didn’t even make the list. Tech isn’t the only industry showing the impact of under-marketing. The highest-ranked automotive brand is Tesla, at 26, the only U.S. car company to make it into the top 100.</p>\n<p>Until companies reverse the trend of underfunding and understaffing marketing, those with poor brand management will continue struggling with less-than-stellar financial performance. It’s a shame to watch Intel Inside degrade this much. I hope Intel can rediscover the drive and focus needed to restore the brand to its former status as a symbol of quality.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD deserve kudos for their successful execution!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N electric sports vehicle in action\" width=\"1000\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/2025-Hyundai-IONIQ-5-N-768x353.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The 2025 Ioniq 5 N electrified sports vehicle (Image Credit: Hyundai)</p>\n<p>I first saw this vehicle the other day when watching a drag race between the <a href=\"https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/ioniq-5-n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IONIQ 5 N</a> and its closest competitor, the Tesla Model 3 Performance. What struck me was that the Hyundai was not only faster but also much more fun to drive.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I once berated Ford’s now ex-CEO because he wasn’t learning enough from Tesla about this “fun” thing, and I suggested that if he didn’t address this, he’d soon be out of a job (and he was).</p>\n<p>The Hyundai Ioniq costs just under $70,000 but packs a ton of performance. It has up to 641 horsepower, a drift optimizer that actually works, along with a boost button, and it accelerates to 60 in 3.25 seconds.</p>\n<p>The only downside is the car’s range of around 220 miles. That’s fine for around town and the drag strip, but it’s not great if you need to take it on a trip. It also had decent fake engine sounds and realistic simulated shifting, which adds to the fun, and its fast hatch design makes it more practical than most performance cars.</p>\n<p>CarWow <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg5kiIYDTYE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raced</a> the Ioniq 5 N against a $300,000 Lamborghini Aventador SV. The Lamborghini wins but only by a car length, and it costs close to 5x the Hyundai. Granted, the Hyundai was overmatched, but in another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTR777QhkGY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">series of races</a>, the Hyundai takes on a variety of high-performance cars and does exceedingly well (I felt sorry for the Porsche GT3 driver).</p>\n<p>I still love my Audi E-Tron GT. Sadly, there is no drag racing with my car, but it does 0 to 60 in 3.6 seconds (the new model is even faster at 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds). So, the Hyundai would beat my 2022 Audi as well. Right now, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is by far the most fun electric car available at a reasonable price, setting a new standard for electric vehicle success, so it is my Product of the Week.</p>\n<p>Maybe Ford, GM, and Stellantis can learn from Hyundai what they clearly have not learned from Tesla: fun sells!</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Last week, Intel shared how its AI technology will be a significant part of the Olympics experience. If Intel pulls this off, it would be a huge boost to its AI efforts. If this doesn’t work, it will reflect poorly on Intel.</p>\n<p>I’ve been involved with two prior Olympics tech efforts, one with IBM and the Winter Olympics and the other with Lenovo and the Summer Olympics.</p>\n<p>While the Lenovo effort worked out reasonably well for Lenovo, the IBM effort was a train wreck that had little to do with IBM’s technology or services and everything to do with the complex nature of the Olympics held in the U.S. that year. France presents unique challenges given some venues’ locations, domestic and foreign efforts to disrupt the event, and the common committee approach to getting things done.</p>\n<p>France also has a vastly different legal structure than much of Europe and the U.S., which can make doing a project like this uniquely difficult. However, if Intel succeeds, AI at the Olympics will make a huge difference to the attendee and athlete experience and make this the most enjoyable Olympics of all time. Though, given how new generative AI is and the complexity of this project, it won’t be a walk in the park.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss Intel, AI, and the Olympics. Then, I’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new Intel laptop from HP that pushes the envelope on sustainability, portability, and security.</p>\n<h3>Challenges Managing the Olympics With Technology</h3>\n<p>The Olympics is a frighteningly unique operation. It spans the world with many different and often unaligned organizations with varying connections to their own governments and only really comes together at scale every four years.</p>\n<p>These groups have different cultural requirements and social protocols and speak different languages. During the interim time between events, people change, relationships between countries change, threats change, and the venue even changes. It is almost like building a large company from scratch over a very short time.</p>\n<p>The first true test of whether most things will function at this scale is when the event goes live. As IBM found out, that is the wrong time to discover catastrophic problems with the implementation.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>However, we’ve learned a lot since that IBM problem, and things have been going well with technology since then. However, unlike those prior events, two large wars are ongoing, which can lead to significant operational issues ranging from the ability to anticipate physical and electronic threats to politically motivated escalations intended to embarrass hosting or attending governments to the difficult-to-manage venues used for these games.</p>\n<p>If the event goes badly, it likely won’t be Intel’s fault, though Intel will likely get the blame. If Intel is successful, it will be a massive showcase of Intel’s AI capabilities, capabilities that would seem to exceed where most think the company currently is. This success would have an extremely positive impact on the brand and its future.</p>\n<p>The risk is in line with the reward, but neither is trivial.</p>\n<h3>AI Could Make a Unique Difference at the Olympics</h3>\n<p>As noted, Olympic gatherings include many people from different places, all arriving at one location that will be new to most of them, and both athletes and observers have to move efficiently between venues.</p>\n<p>If there is a venue change, weather event, terrorist threat, operational problem, protest (France is infamous for these), or other major issue, many people will need to be notified and guided to safety.</p>\n<p>In addition, resources will need to be redeployed rapidly to deal with the issue while mitigating athlete and attendee risk. AI is ideally suited for this, as it can, through training and simulation based on past practices included in the training sets, be ready to respond to any anticipated problem and provide timely advice and direction for any unanticipated issue.</p>\n<p>This last is incredibly important given the typical staff changes from country to country where you don’t often have experienced decision-makers where you need them, leading to catastrophic mistakes. Done right, AI has the unique ability to come up with and provide a critical response to an unanticipated problem in real time.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In addition, AI can provide attendees and athletes with direction to events they might be interested in that they otherwise wouldn’t have known about, suggestions on where to get help if they need it, and automated alerting for injuries or activities that would require Olympic or police response.</p>\n<p>AI can provide suggestions about useful applications for attendees and athletes, locations for affordable and memorable dining and recreational experiences, and souvenirs and other things people can buy to remember the event. This can push the revenue side of this effort more effectively and result in less financial loss to the host country and businesses (the Olympics are rarely profitable).</p>\n<p>If used properly, AI could restore profitability to this event, though I doubt that will be the case this year, given that this is the first real use of AI at the Olympics.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>AI could make a massive difference to those competing in and attending the Olympics. The question is whether that will be a positive or negative difference and how much a technology supplier like Intel will be hurt or benefit.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>The good news for Intel is that this is hardly the first time the Olympics has used advanced tech, and the organization has become more experienced over time regarding how best to use new technologies. The bad news is that while it is maturing rapidly, AI is still new to events like this. The Olympics is unusually complex and challenging to manage, particularly when multiple wars create tensions between the athletes and attendees.</p>\n<p>If Intel pulls this off, it will have hard-earned a significant amount of credit and immediately become a far more powerful AI vendor. But this is a high-risk event during a time of conflict, so the possibility this will go badly is unusually high this time. While I think the reward will justify the risk, the risk is anything but trivial.</p>\n<p>Here’s to hoping Intel and France knock this year’s Summer Olympics out of the park.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>HP EliteBook 1040 14” G11 Notebook PC Wolf Pro Security Edition</h3>\n<p>We live in an increasingly hostile environment. While companies like Panasonic and its Toughbook line focus on physical threats to hardware, HP’s latest notebook focuses on security exposures, making the <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-1040-14-inch-g11-notebook-pc-wolf-pro-security-edition-p-a6st6ua-aba-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP EliteBook 1040 14” G11 Wolf Pro Security Edition</a> likely the safest notebook to own.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of the new line of Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite notebooks is a powerful NPU and great battery life. Still, one of the disadvantages is that security software doesn’t yet fully embrace that platform and doesn’t support vPro. Intel’s vPro is often a standard requirement for enterprise-class products.</p>\n<p>This EliteBook is a purely business-focused product targeting those in vertical markets and governments with higher security requirements than most. But after watching the movie “The Beekeeper,” I was reminded just how exposed individuals are to security threats, particularly those that have senior corporate positions or extensive systems access — like CIOs, systems administrators, and support specialists.</p>\n<p>Those classes of jobs are at higher risk because someone could use their permissions to gain access and steal a lot of sensitive data. Given security threats are increasingly AI-driven, having a notebook specifically designed to protect against threats like this could be a godsend for those who are highly likely to be compromised.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/HP-EliteBook-1040.jpg\" alt=\"HP EliteBook 1040 14” G11 Notebook PC Wolf Pro Security Edition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/HP-EliteBook-1040.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/HP-EliteBook-1040-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/HP-EliteBook-1040-768x369.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>HP EliteBook 1040 14” G11 Notebook PC Wolf Pro Security Edition (Images Credit: HP)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This PC is also a showcase of sustainability using, when possible, ocean-born plastics that either came from the ocean or would have ended up in it, like fishing nets, recycled cooking oil for some of the plastics, and recycled metals for the frame and case. HP is more aggressive than most with its <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/sustainable-impact.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use of recycled materials</a>.</p>\n<p>At around $2,100, this isn’t an inexpensive notebook, but it is well-provisioned with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor with 14 cores and 22 threads. It comes with 16GB of memory, 512GB SSD, and Intel’s new ARC graphics system, which is significantly more powerful than its old integrated graphics solution.</p>\n<p>This notebook also has an NPU, but it runs at 11 TOPS, making it an AI PC that doesn’t qualify for Microsoft Copilot+. Most AI deployments remain cloud-based, and HP’s AI apps should work within these 11 TOPS limits, so this isn’t as bad a disadvantage as it otherwise might be, though I expect once we can get vPro and a 40+ TOPS NPU, IT folks will be far happier.</p>\n<p>The EliteBook 1040 comes in a silver-white finish that I haven’t seen before but is growing on me because it doesn’t seem to fingerprint or show dirt as much as some darker colors do. In the heat we are currently experiencing, I expect it will also perform far cooler than a darker product. It’ll also sense when it is on your lap, dialing back performance and heat so you don’t iron your privates. No one wants ironed privates.</p>\n<p>For someone with a remarkably high-security requirement, who needs Intel vPro, and who can, for now, live without a higher-performance NPU, this could be your ideal product, so the HP EliteBook 1040 14” G11 Notebook Wolf Pro Security Edition is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Apple’s greatest fear is that its exalted iPhone has become too foreseeable. For the most part, it has largely remained the same during the previous seven years, with incremental upgrades to its cameras, CPUs, and battery life.</p>\n<p>However, Apple attempted to break free from this predictability on Monday by releasing the first iPhone models <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/apple-weaves-ai-into-latest-watch-airpods-iphone-models-179356.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">designed for artificial intelligence</a> from the “ground up,” a phrase that CEO Tim Cook used in his opening remarks.</p>\n<p>Consistent with its prior virtual product launches that spawned during the Covid era, the company hosted a prerecorded video from its Silicon Valley headquarters to unveil the iPhone 16, available in four variants optimized for Apple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI-powered system. According to Apple, the phones will have enhanced capabilities such as message sorting, recommendation writing, and an upgraded Siri, making it a more powerful virtual assistant.</p>\n<p>The firm also revealed the Apple Watch Series 10, which features a larger, brighter display about 10% slimmer than its Series 9 predecessor. Apple also unveiled a new model, AirPods Pro, which can function as a professional-grade hearing aid — Apple’s first foray into that area — and automatically reduce noise at concerts or near construction sites.</p>\n<h3>Betting on AI to Boost Sluggish iPhone Sales</h3>\n<p>The release of the new phones is critical for Apple, as sales have been sluggish since 2021. The last time the company saw meaningful iPhone year-over-year growth in unit sales was largely due to the introduction of 5G.</p>\n<p>Apple has struggled recently because iPhone owners have held onto their phones longer. By reorganizing its engineering teams to focus on artificial intelligence, it has placed a significant wager that the technology capable of producing images, writing software, and responding to queries will convince consumers to purchase new gadgets.</p>\n<p>With these announcements, Apple is attempting to play a significant role in bringing AI to the masses. Although Microsoft, Google, and Samsung have added generative AI features to products, these features have not yet been broadly utilized. However, as demonstrated by digital music players, smartphones, and smartwatches, Apple has shown in the past that it is willing to wait to adopt and promote developing technologies.</p>\n<h3>The Gen AI Kool-Aid Factor</h3>\n<p>Although AI is the current buzzword with many consumers, the jury is still out on whether most mainstream users will drink the Apple Intelligence Kool-Aid and move to upgrade their current iPhones.</p>\n<p>Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have showcased impressive demos over several months. Still, it remains unclear whether AI’s benefits will motivate users to upgrade their iPhones or remain a “bright, shiny object” by skeptical consumers.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Viewed in that vein, when one compares Apple Intelligence to what the company advertised in June when it unveiled the technology, the iPhone 16 has fewer features at launch.</p>\n<p>Starting next month, users will be able to find photos more quickly by describing an image to Siri, receive summarized notifications, and get writing tips from their phones. Additionally, thanks to artificial intelligence, the camera will recognize specific types of plants, flowers, or dog breeds.</p>\n<h3>Will Consumers Trade Privacy for AI Convenience?</h3>\n<p>Of course, all of these benefits require mainstream users to grant access to an unprecedented level of personal information on their smartphones, and it’s still unclear whether they are prepared to make these privacy concessions in return for thoroughly enjoying the benefits that AI offers.</p>\n<p>Other features will be added gradually. For example, Siri can handle phone requests involving personal information, such as extracting flight information from a family member’s text message and contacting the airline to find arrival details in real time.</p>\n<p>Requests not involving personal data will be sent to ChatGPT, accessible on iPhones following Apple’s partnership with OpenAI in the spring.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s Cautious Approach to Generative AI</h3>\n<p>The iPhone’s constrained feature set reflects Apple’s conservative approach to generative AI compared to its competitors.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Google unveiled the Pixel phone last month, featuring a conversational virtual assistant, the capability to edit users into photos, and the capacity to ask complicated questions using the company’s generative AI chatbot, Gemini.</p>\n<p>Google has also seen AI blunders, such as a chatbot that produced laughable (and sometimes disturbing) results.</p>\n<h3>New iPhones 16 Models Feature Modest Updates</h3>\n<p>Apple launched the iPhone 16 in four variants, each featuring a redesigned camera button.</p>\n<p>The entry-level devices, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, have a more powerful camera, a quicker processor, and a physical “Action” button that users can set to access features like the phone’s flashlight immediately.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are the more expensive models, starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively. They have slightly larger displays, a bigger battery, and the capacity to record audio at studio quality. That latter feature will undoubtedly reinforce the iPhone Pro brand as the go-to device for users with computational video and photography applications.</p>\n<p>The Pro line phones have identical processors that power Apple Intelligence. The A18 chip is used in the standard iPhone 16, whereas the A18 Pro processor is in the iPhone 16 Pro. Compared to previous years, the upgrade results in a less noticeable difference between the capabilities of the more expensive and less expensive phones.</p>\n<h3>Apple’s International Challenges</h3>\n<p>Apple faces additional difficulties as the world enters the generative AI era. For most of the 17 years that the iPhone has existed, the company created a single software system that it updated globally. However, more countries require that the data and computer systems underpinning artificial intelligence be housed inside their borders.</p>\n<p>It’s logical to assume that AI systems will, over time, ultimately recognize users’ linguistic and cultural variations. This development, in turn, may require Apple to develop more specialized software for the nations where iPhones are sold.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>This implication represents an enormous software complexity undertaking, which the company may have to prepare itself for from a resources standpoint.</p>\n<p>During the launch event, Apple pointed out that a preliminary software upgrade for Apple Intelligence will be available in the United States starting next month. Later this year, Apple plans to widen the rollout of Apple Intelligence to English-speaking countries in Europe, the Pacific Rim, and South Africa, leaving most countries without Apple Intelligence until next year.</p>\n<h3>The Untested Future of Apple Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Apple Intelligence offers significant improvements in user experience through innovative AI-driven features, personalized interfaces, and enhanced privacy, but its impact on fueling iPhone sales remains a nuanced question.</p>\n<p>These innovations may provide a compelling reason to upgrade for tech enthusiasts and users deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem. However, for more price-sensitive or casual consumers, the incremental nature of these enhancements — especially in a saturated smartphone market — may not be enough to drive widespread sales growth.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Apple’s ability to maintain strong iPhone sales will depend on the allure of its cutting-edge AI features and broader market factors such as pricing strategy, economic conditions, and competition from rivals like Samsung and Google.</p>\n<p>The jury is still out on whether consumers will take the gen-AI bait — though Apple’s renowned messaging and brand strength may give it a reasonable shot.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Before this year’s Worldwide Developer Conference, which Apple conducted earlier this week, AI meant artificial intelligence to most consumers. In classic Apple-esque fashion, we now know the Cupertino-based company wants to redefine AI as “Apple Intelligence.”</p>\n<p>Apple has consistently demonstrated its prowess in effectively communicating complex technologies to laypeople. At <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/apple-intelligence-headlines-wwdc24-kickoff-event-179232.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WWDC</a>, the company clearly articulated how it will incorporate these latest developments in artificial intelligence into its software on a platform-wide basis.</p>\n<p>Some consumers have been skeptical about using artificial intelligence beyond the much-hyped tasks of creating a dinner party menu, for example. For those users, and it’s not a trivial audience from a size standpoint, those use cases are not innovations that will change the world.</p>\n<p>Now, things get a lot more interesting when an Apple Intelligence-infused Siri can search across apps, emails, and text messages to retrieve information saved somewhere you can’t remember or to check the status of a flight. For instance, Siri will cross-reference flight details from an email with real-time updates from the web, highlighting a practical application of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<h3>More Steak, Less Sizzle</h3>\n<p>Competitors had already revealed a few new features; during its developer conference last month, Google debuted a photo search functionality strikingly similar to what Apple unveiled at its keynote. Nevertheless, the show served as a helpful reminder of the iPhone maker’s significant advantage over rival tech firms when showcasing cutting-edge technology on its own gear.</p>\n<p>Viewed through this prism, Apple Intelligence suddenly materializes in a way it hasn’t until now. In stark contrast, Sundar Pichai’s recent Google I/O presentation came across as dramatically more technical than intended for the general audience.</p>\n<p>The big question is how much of what Apple showed will result in increased consumer spending, and we won’t get an answer until the iPhone 16 expected announcement in September. Legacy iPhone users must upgrade to an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max to use its new AI-powered capabilities. However, AI will also be available on newer Macs and iPads that utilize Apple Silicon.</p>\n<h3>AI Boost to Soft iPhone Sales?</h3>\n<p>Given that iPhone sales decreased in the previous fiscal year and the first half of this one, any influence on those sales would be significant. However, there’s no guarantee that these enhancements will convince the typical consumer, who may not want to spend over $1,000 for the newest premium phone — either in full upfront or over three years, as most mobile plans currently permit — and may not pay attention to tech news.</p>\n<p>More importantly, it’s still an open question whether these features function as well in real life as they did in the demos at WWDC. To Apple’s credit, the online demos given during the WWDC keynote were compelling and intuitive, an Apple trademark. Still, consumers are notoriously finicky, and this remains an open question.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as I’ve suggested during my podcasts, Apple has all the resources necessary to swiftly replicate a Microsoft Copilot-like framework across all its device operating systems. Sequoia (the forthcoming upgrade to macOS), iOS 18, and iPadOS 18 will perfectly position Apple to amplify the benefits of its vaunted ecosystem.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>It’s also notable that Apple’s ability to offer a large selection of developer tools that utilize Apple Intelligence capabilities will add a powerful AI dimension to the Apple App Store.</p>\n<p>App Intents is an intriguing addition to Shortcuts, which enables AI agent capabilities so developers may provide their consumers with generative AI-based automation. Along with the Matter initiative, this capability will turbocharge smart home applications, which have been a morass of multiple applications and tedious setups.</p>\n<h3>Privacy, Privacy, More Privacy</h3>\n<p>As anticipated, Apple prioritized privacy as the bedrock of Apple Intelligence. The additional functions and features appear to operate on-device (iPhone 15 and Apple Silicon iPads and Macs).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the company unveiled “Private Cloud Compute,” which enables Apple Intelligence to be “scaled” to servers using Apple Silicon. Apple proudly talked about how Apple Intelligence gets smarter by understanding user habits and preferences, but it keeps this information private. Most of the intelligence happens right on your device.</p>\n<p>Still, Apple will use a unique cloud system that protects your privacy even when using extra processing power for super complex tasks. That’s a big commitment, and Apple didn’t provide specific details.</p>\n<p>Though some publications claim that OpenAI’s generative toolkit is the basis of Apple Intelligence, whether gen AI models or services underpin the system is still unclear. Since OpenAI is mentioned as a partner on the “world model” rather than as a primary “supplier” of Apple Intelligence (much to Elon Musk’s chagrin), it appears that these models may be Apple-only.</p>\n<p>Demos indicate that ChatGPT will be available for free and most likely under the same conditions of use, with roomier integration in Apple operating systems and apps. Apple appears to be approaching this like a plug-in version, similar to GPT-4o’s introduction of a macOS application.</p>\n<p>The company’s refreshing emphasis on privacy appears to confirm that the incremental cost of supporting these features of Apple Intelligence is more important than profitability. Apple did not mention whether Apple Intelligence fees were covered by iCloud membership income or transferred to individual devices. If this is true, it’s a new business model issue that will impact many third-party AI providers outside of Apple.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>It is unclear how the Apple Intelligence architecture maintains privacy and security while enabling contextual continuity across devices. However, this goes directly to Apple’s bifurcated strategy for executing a personalized and external AI experience.</p>\n<p>We need to know more about how Apple will manage all of this, but it’s unquestionably a strategy that will differentiate Apple from the likes of Microsoft and Google.</p>\n<p>Apple’s substantial smartphone market share significantly bolsters its ability to execute its Apple Intelligence capability. With a vast and loyal user base, Apple can gather extensive data to refine and enhance its AI algorithms, ensuring more personalized and efficient user experiences.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The widespread adoption of iPhones provides a robust platform for seamlessly integrating AI features across devices, fostering a cohesive ecosystem. This market dominance also attracts top talent and encourages substantial investment in AI research and development, further propelling Apple’s advancements in artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has promised magic; instead, it is frequently imperfect and primarily valuable for a small number of tasks. It’s hard to blame most consumers for being skeptical. A recent study indicates that less than 10% of Americans use ChatGPT daily.</p>\n<p>OpenAI announced a chattier version of its chatbot earlier in the year, but it didn’t have most of the features the company discussed. In addition, Google scaled back its AI image generator and the AI-powered search results after high-profile flubs this year. Amazon showed an error-prone AI-upgraded Alexa last year that is yet to be released. Those miscues aren’t Apple’s fault, and the company is usually wary of releasing products before they’re polished.</p>\n<p>However, Apple and other companies are under tremendous pressure to show their AI expertise to investors, employees, and business partners. Skeptics might question whether AI is really targeted at consumers or if it’s mostly a corporate self-interest play.</p>\n<p>Putting all this aside, I tend to be an optimist, and I eagerly await how this pans out. I will be an early beta tester of everything announced at WWDC24 and will focus on assessing its usefulness, intuitiveness, and privacy protections. Stay tuned.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>On paper, Lenovo Group and Dell Technologies are remarkably alike, but the two companies are organized and run differently. That will become clear to most who compare last week’s Lenovo Tech World 2024 event to Dell’s similar event next month.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the difference is the nature of both companies’ acquisitions and executive leadership. Lenovo’s leadership is geographically diverse, making it a truly global company, while Dell’s is primarily centralized in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Although Michael Dell was instrumental in the company’s growth, he appears to have almost retired in place. Meanwhile, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, known as YY, is still a vibrant part of the company’s management.</p>\n<p>This difference allows Lenovo to move much more decisively on industry changes, while Dell appears unable to make big moves and has to undergo massive layoffs to make the same pivot to AI that Lenovo has already made.</p>\n<p>Another difference is the extent to which Lenovo is using AI. It’s already using AI operationally and selling mature AI solutions, while Dell still appears stuck on trying to sell a concept that the firm does not seem to know how to use yet. Dell’s marketing is doing a decent job of covering for these shortcomings, but the layoffs imply most customers are not fooled.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss some of the highlights from Lenovo Tech World 2024. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, an interesting, mechanized laptop that Lenovo highlighted at the event.</p>\n<h3>The Powerful Open</h3>\n<p>In the opening moments of an event like this, you can often see where a company’s heart and focus are. It might do something humorous or feature the leading offering, but occasionally, I am surprised, and this was one of those times.</p>\n<p>Lenovo opened with a demonstration featuring an individual with advanced ALS who cannot speak and can only move her eyes. But Lenovo had fashioned an AI solution for her so that, using AI, she could talk again. This breakthrough is monumental for individuals with ALS, enabling both speech and online interaction.</p>\n<p>This demonstration was incredibly powerful, and Lenovo followed up by covering what it’s doing for education with AI. Education is interesting because while it enormously impacts the world, the segment is not very profitable. Personalized learning for students using AI could be a massive benefit, as it should better engage those students and significantly increase the effectiveness of education across all demographics.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Automated AI quizzes coupled with classes that teach using multiple AIs to create more compelling documents and reports should far better prepare students for the AI future than any other existing curriculum.</p>\n<p>Both things told me that Lenovo is more about making a difference than making a profit, which is incredibly important when talking about a technology that could eliminate many jobs.</p>\n<p>Lenovo made it clear that it is not working on AI to replace people but as a tool that would make students, people with disabilities, and employees more valuable rather than redundant over time. This approach stands in stark contrast to Dell’s recent AI-related layoffs.</p>\n<h3>Lenovo’s AI Library</h3>\n<p>One of the more interesting offerings at the event was the Lenovo AI Library. Most companies are nowhere near as advanced as Lenovo in using AI. However, Lenovo’s journey to AI has created a massive amount of information. The company has now placed it in a library that can help its customers gain the insights they need to make informed AI solutions.</p>\n<p>Too many vendors are marketing AI as if it were an end in itself, similar to how digital transformation was once promoted rather than a tool to achieve specific business goals. This should ensure that Lenovo’s customers succeed while most other efforts are still, unfortunately, incurring significant failures.</p>\n<h3>Blended Hybrid AI</h3>\n<p>Where Lenovo stands out when it comes to these efforts is the blending of multiple AIs into a solution.</p>\n<p>Like people, AIs are not all equal and are best suited for the tasks they were designed to handle. However, many projects require diverse skills, often necessitating using multiple AI systems for successful completion. Lenovo’s hybrid AI approach is unique in recognizing this, offering greater real-world benefits and a higher likelihood of success.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>One example of this was the Lenovo AI paralegal. My wife and I are watching the old TV show “Suits,” which does a surprisingly excellent job of pointing out the critical nature of paralegals. These people are overworked, and much of what they do requires massive amounts of research, where a mistake can make the difference between winning and losing a case.</p>\n<p>Another powerful example was using AI for <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/applied-behavior-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Applied Behavior Analysis</a> (ABA) therapy. Qualified ABA practitioners are expensive, and only relatively wealthy children have access to this type of therapy, which is increasingly critical given how much damage social media tools like TikTok are doing to them. The use of AI in this context could tremendously reduce the growing depression and behavioral problems today’s kids are suffering.</p>\n<h3>Lenovo Supplier Partnerships</h3>\n<p>Lenovo has long had a robust partnering culture. Most OEMs are at arm’s length from their technology suppliers, and our industry is famous for vendor conflict.</p>\n<p>Lenovo collaborates surprisingly closely with its suppliers, which has paid dividends in the past with workstations. Lenovo uniquely adopted AMD’s Threadripper and almost immediately took workstation leadership. Today, Lenovo’s closeness with Nvidia is what has paid off. Lenovo showcased what is arguably the best Nvidia <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blackwell</a> solution, which is cooled with Lenovo’s 6th-generation warm-water cooling technology, <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/servers-storage/neptune/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neptune</a>.</p>\n<p>Blackwell is incredibly powerful but also uses a lot of power and generates a great deal of heat. Neptune cools the part cost-effectively, which addresses two of the shortcomings associated with a part in this class. Neptune is today’s most widely used and efficient cooling technology for data centers.</p>\n<h3>Vehicle Computing and Robotics</h3>\n<p>Over a decade ago, Dell predicted at Dell World that robotics would become the next big thing for enterprises. Autonomous vehicles have since emerged as the leading class of autonomous robots, with other types of robots also developing. This year, Lenovo reinforced this idea by showcasing current solutions, while Dell has yet to follow through on its prediction.</p>\n<p>Working with Nvidia, Lenovo showcased a Blackwell-based drive solution for cars with 2000 TOPS (Trillions or Tera Operations per Second). High-performance AI PCs have only 40 TOPS. Dell looked at doing this over five years ago but never executed a growing problem with that company due to a lack of clear leadership and willingness to take critical risks.</p>\n<p>Lenovo also highlighted its version of the autonomous robotic dog. Other firms have advanced robotic dogs, but Lenovo is the first in its class to do this.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Lenovo-6-legged-robot.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo 6-legged robot at Tech World 2024\" width=\"576\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Lenovo-6-legged-robot.jpg 576w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Lenovo-6-legged-robot-300x250.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></p>\n<p>Lenovo’s 6-legged robot displayed at Tech World 2024 (Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>In addition, while Lenovo is not yet using Nvidia’s Omniverse for simulation training (it tends to leave training up to the customer), Lenovo is already anticipating that use, moving it toward the front of the line for automobile and autonomous robotic training. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Occasionally, an OEM surprises me, but I’ve been disappointed by how companies like Dell have approached AI sales and deployment to date. Many are not yet using AI extensively themselves and, as a result, lack the understanding needed to drive successful implementations. Lenovo, however, isn’t just pushing AI; it’s offering complete AI solutions — from education to robotics — positioning itself and its customers for the future of AI.</p>\n<p>For me, it was the work in education that I found to be the most compelling. Technology is doing massive harm to kids now, and we need to prioritize technological solutions to address this critical problem. I found a kindred heart in Lenovo; its focus here could save many kids from uncertain futures.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC Concept</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/ThinkBook-Auto-Twist.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo Auto Twist AI PC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/ThinkBook-Auto-Twist.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/ThinkBook-Auto-Twist-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/ThinkBook-Auto-Twist-768x369.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>(Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>I typically put products you can buy in this section, but I was so impressed with this concept that I am making an exception this week.</p>\n<p>I have an expensive automotive hobby, and I often watch videos on how to do this while working on my cars. The problem is that seeing the screen as I move around the vehicle usually requires that I reposition the tablet or PC several times, but my hands are greasy and can make a mess of that hardware, not to mention that there are times when my hands are otherwise engaged.</p>\n<p>The ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept looks like a regular laptop, but the screen rotates to follow you around the room. So, if you are cooking, working on a project (like a car), or otherwise moving around, the screen automatically moves to follow you. This demo video is pretty cool:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lenovo Twist AI PC Concept Demo: MUST Watch, It Sees And Obeys!\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHhvySjZuh4\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the Amazon Alexa versions did this a few years ago, and I found it incredibly useful, but the device always had to be plugged in. Plus, Alexa’s capabilities limited it, and since Alexa isn’t a PC, it couldn’t access the videos I wanted to watch.</p>\n<p>The PC that Nvidia is secretly working on will take this concept further (and may not even need an OS like Windows), but the ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept comes closer to what I think it will be than anything else I have seen. This thing is <em>awesome</em>, so it’s my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>One of the most important technology trends in higher education is the growing use of 4K visual displays, which transform an ordinary classroom, student center, or e-sports arena into a fully immersive student experience.</p>\n<p>According to a 2023 survey by <a href=\"https://www.wgulabs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WGU Labs</a> and the College Innovation Network, two-thirds of higher education instructors anticipate using more technology over the next three years. This trend indicates that high-end audio-visual (AV) technology will continue to expand in classrooms. The report found that 82% of respondents believe that access to technology directly impacts student engagement.</p>\n<p>For example, professors can envelop their students in the day’s lesson with 360° projections of vibrant imagery. Imagine being an art history student surrounded by Picasso’s portfolio of works while sitting at your desk.</p>\n<p>That quality of surround visual immersion is no longer reserved for high-end academic and entertainment venues. It is also cropping up in corporate and dynamic worship service settings.</p>\n<p>To meet those needs, <a href=\"https://na.panasonic.com/us/panasonic-connect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Panasonic Connect</a> in June announced an expansion of its AV Solution Suite at InfoComm 2024. The company plans to power innovative and engaging visual experiences across industries.</p>\n<p>“As more industries seek to implement immersive visual experiences, they will need to adopt reliable, powerful solutions that give content creators and production teams flexibility,” said Jared Darensbourg, director of sales for Visual Systems at Panasonic Connect.</p>\n<p>The latest additions to its ecosystem of AV solutions respond directly to this industry need, he offered. These solutions help customers worry less about the technology setup and focus more on how they can take their creativity and audience experience to the next level.</p>\n<h3>Panasonic Connect AV Solutions for Higher Education</h3>\n<p>The commercial audio-visual division of Panasonic has been selling high-end projectors and displays to higher education for multiple use cases for the better part of 50 years, along with PTZ cameras for 16 years. These robotic video cameras provide enhanced graphic features that can pan horizontally, tilt vertically, and zoom in on a subject to improve image quality without digital distortion.</p>\n<p>The newest models included in Panasonic Connect’s announcement do not need to be controlled by a remote operator. They make broadcast quality affordable and easy to use when integrated with other software technologies for recording and live streaming.</p>\n<p>Panasonic Connect fed the frenzy four years ago with wireless microphones as the trend for better visual and audio technologies in college classrooms and lecture halls matured. This year, it is adding its ceiling microphone, according to Petro Shimonishi, director of product management for Panasonic Connect.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>“We developed the ceiling microphone with input from close to 80 universities. We traveled and visited a lot of universities about ceiling microphones, what they liked, what they didn’t like, and we came up with some pretty unique features for education,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Panasonic Connect is heavily involved with several higher-education organizations to keep up with high-end educational needs. These organizations include the Higher Ed Technology Managers Association (HETMA), The Edtech Collective at <a href=\"https://www.instructure.com/partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instructure</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.educause.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EduCause</a>.</p>\n<p>“We leverage a lot of our relationships with higher education to closely understand what their needs are, especially in terms of classroom technology, and then develop products that are specifically suited for the demands of the higher education space,” said Shimonishi.</p>\n<h3>Post-Covid Improvements Transforming Instructional Images</h3>\n<p>Covid’s impact on the classroom is driving the adoption of new technology within higher education, according to Shimonishi. Speakers and projectors hanging from ceilings make it easier to create space for some of the other products getting installed.</p>\n<p>The big difference in post-Covid education is that college students’ expectations for hybrid remote education are a priority. Experiences with audio-visual technology are now vastly different between K-12 and higher education.</p>\n<p>While remote learning was largely unsuccessful below college, we are seeing the expectation of college and university students wanting to retain that capability. They want to take a class anytime, anywhere, Shimonishi observed.</p>\n<p>“Some universities were telling me that all of their classes are still hybrid. They have students who will sit outside in the quad on the grass, out like 200 feet away from classrooms, and take the class remotely because that’s their expectation, and that’s how they want to learn,” she offered.</p>\n<p>Since the hybrid approach in higher education is here to stay, better cameras and microphones for capturing teachers and students are necessary. With Panasonic’s software, the teacher comes in, hits a button on the touchscreen, and the system instantly recognizes the teacher as the image to follow around the room.</p>\n<h3>Adopting High Tech Has Added Benefits</h3>\n<p>In cases where AV integrity is essential, tech items, such as high-quality ceiling microphones and 4K cameras, make audience engagement work. For instance, if a student or assistant walks in front of the teacher to hand out materials, the ceiling camera does not get confused. This clarity provides remote students with a much more engaging experience.</p>\n<p>“It is just a carryover from Covid in higher ed. We see more universities, even on the community college level, are installing this type of equipment,” Shimonishi said. Perhaps it is an unexpected consequence. One of these is improved student recruiting.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“When parents visit colleges, the number one thing they want to know about is the education program. Since so many of us use technology in our day-to-day lives, having a good classroom technology suite is a recruiting mechanism for many of these universities,” she suggested.</p>\n<p>For instance, Kairos is a live production platform that provides unlimited control to deliver rich content for broadcast, large screen display, and live streams in 4K HDR. It adds the ST 2110 standard baseband and streaming connectivity for input/output flexibility.

      "content": "<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta (Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg headlined at Siggraph last week.</p>\n<p>While the fireside chat with Huang didn’t really cover any new territory, the subsequent chat between Zuckerberg and Huang was fascinating, particularly when it came to what they didn’t talk about, which was the future of Facebook with AI. But, based on what they did say, I think I can fill that gap.</p>\n<p>The two men differed on the future of personal technology, mainly because Zuckerberg talked about what could be done, while Huang focused on what should be done. That dynamic is worth exploring, so we’ll do that this week.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a godsend at this time of year if you want to sleep cool but don’t want to spend a fortune running the air conditioner all night.</p>\n<h3>Zuckerberg Remake</h3>\n<p>The session between Zuckerberg and Huang was fascinating to watch for several reasons, not the least of which was that Zuckerberg presented as a real person instead of the android-like character he typically reflects. He was personable, seemed to truly like Huang, and came across not only as smart, which he has done, but personable, which is new.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of “Star Trek: The Next Generation” when Lore showed up as Data’s more emotional twin brother. Zuckerberg’s people skills have improved dramatically since last I saw him, which undoubtedly took a ton of work that paid off. I think he will be far better received now. If you watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-cmMcMZoZ4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> and put aside your prior impressions of the guy, Zuckerberg presents himself as bright but normal, which is a huge improvement.</p>\n<h3>The Future of Personal Technology</h3>\n<p>Huang and Zuckerberg spoke about many things, but when they started discussing advanced AR/VR headsets, it felt like they had drifted into what would come after smartphones.</p>\n<p>You see, smartphones are still primarily based on the GUI interface that we initially got with PCs. In many ways, they are just small PCs with touchscreens instead of keyboards and mice. However, AI, particularly conversational AI, can use natural language as the interface. Talking to your smartphone might be an initial implementation, but wouldn’t it be better if you wore the thing that would put the microphone closer to your face and, with a glasses form factor, the display in front of your eyes?</p>\n<p>People walk around today with their faces buried in their phones, which is incredibly unsafe. But if you were able to put the display translucently in front of their eyes and coupled that with a camera, similar to what self-driving cars have, then the glasses could warn you to avoid obstacles (and vehicles), and your hands would be free to carry stuff or help with balance.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg was still thinking about his Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which will take commands, convey sounds, and capture images. However, they lack a built-in display because it would double the cost and make the glasses heavy and bulky. He was right that people have resisted wearing a heavy headset like Apple’s Vision Pro, which comes closest in terms of capabilities to what Huang was talking about as the future.</p>\n<p><video poster=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/meta-ray-ban-poster.jpg\" controls=\"controls\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><source src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/031524_Sky_Mega-Mix_Multi-Feature_Mega-Mix-AI-30_16x9_Master_HD_H264.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses (Video Credit: Meta)</p>\n<p>He was also correct that the bar for such a headset should include the visual capabilities of the Vision Pro, only in a more glasses-like form factor that was also much lighter. The technology for that isn’t ready yet, which is why Zuckerberg’s short-term vision has traction. Still, I agree that the bar for true success would be closer to an updated Vision Pro (or Meta Quest) in terms of capabilities but closer to the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in terms of weight and battery life.</p>\n<p>This eventual device could replace smartphones and represent a massive pivot to the AI digital assistant world of natural language devices that learn how to collaborate better with you rather than you having to learn to collaborate better with it.</p>\n<h3>The Future Facebook</h3>\n<p>One troubling part of the conversation between the two men was Zuckerberg’s discussion of recommendation engines and how they could be applied to enterprise e-commerce systems.</p>\n<p>What troubled me is that it sounded identical to what some folks over at Netscape did, which resulted in that company’s demise. Developing enterprise software is complex and requires a brand that enterprise buyers will accept, and neither Facebook nor Meta have that brand. I know at least one ex-Netscape person is on Meta’s board, and I hope this person hasn’t convinced Zuckerberg to repeat Netscape’s terminal mistake.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, using a recommendation engine on Facebook could significantly impact how ads are presented and improve the introduction of users with common interests. This improvement would return Facebook to its roots as an introduction product for making and sustaining friendships.</p>\n<p>With the proper use of AI, Facebook could become a far better advertising platform. Most of the scam ads I used to get on Facebook have disappeared, suggesting it has done impressive work over the last few years.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Imagine a future Facebook that not only surfaced products and services you didn’t know of but might want to buy but also people you’ve never met with similar personalities and interests that you might enjoy as more than just Facebook friends.</p>\n<p>Properly used, AI could improve Facebook to the point where it could help people avoid loneliness at any age by connecting them to people or AIs they can talk to without being scammed or abused.</p>\n<p>On this last, Huang and Zuckerberg spoke about digital humans, with some discussion on how Huang’s digital self is progressing. The idea of being able to create digital clones that could act in your stead if busy or that could engage with people who have difficulty with human interactions while training them to be better could provide a tremendous amount of improvement.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>The discussion between Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg at Siggraph is worth watching. One represents the creation of AI technology, while the other is more focused on its use, though both cross over. Through discussions like this, you gain a sense of where the technology is and where it is successful and a stronger understanding of where the technology is likely to go in the near term.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>In this case, the concept of a smartphone replacement that you’d wear on your head like glasses spoke to the future evolution of personal technology, while the discussion on AIs and recommendation engines began to clarify the future of Facebook, with some possibility that Meta might repeat Netscape’s mistakes.</p>\n<p>Learning about potential futures helps us prepare for them, making this year’s Siggraph main stage event a must-see.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Chilipad Pro</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/Chilipad-Dock-Pro-Sleep-System.jpg\" alt=\"Chilipad Dock Pro Sleep System\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/Chilipad-Dock-Pro-Sleep-System.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/Chilipad-Dock-Pro-Sleep-System-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/Chilipad-Dock-Pro-Sleep-System-768x476.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>(Image Credit: Sleepme)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sleep.me/current-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chilipad Pro</a> is my Product of the Week at least once a year because it helps me sleep. Like a lot of people, I don’t like to be hot when I sleep, so the Chilipad, particularly the Chilipad Pro, is a godsend this time of year when it is hot and I can’t open the windows because of all the wildfire smoke.</p>\n<p>This year, a competing product is out called the <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/product/shop-pod-cover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eight Sleep Pod 4</a>, which I haven’t tried. Based on the reviews I’ve seen, it uses one control head, while the Chilipad Pro has two. It has a less comfortable mattress topper but a larger water repository, so you don’t have to fill it as often, and it blends in better in your home.</p>\n<p>Chilipad has optional accessories that monitor sleep quality and makes recommendations for a subscription price, while Eight Sleep has integrated this capability but requires a subscription to its services. I’m leery of subscription payments, so I haven’t tried the Eight Sleep or the Chilipad options, but both monitor your sleep and can make recommendations.</p>\n<p>Both products use water that is heated and cooled based on your needs. If you have ever messed with your car’s cooling system, you know that water does a far better job than air of conveying temperature — which is why astronauts and race car drivers use similar technology to keep themselves cool.</p>\n<p>The advantage is that regardless of the room temperature and for a lower cost than running an air conditioner, you can sleep with a ton of covers and still be cool in the summer. Because they don’t create an electric field, these technologies are arguably more efficient than electric blankets or traditional heating pads and likely better for you.</p>\n<p>My 27-pound Maine Coon cat got on the bed while we were washing the sheets and caused the mattress cover to leak, so I had to do without my Chilipad Pro for a couple of weeks. I was miserable and reminded how much I depend on the Chilipad. Because this is one of the few products I can’t live without at this time of the year, the Chilipad Pro is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>When ChatGPT exploded on the tech scene in November 2022, one of the burning questions in the minds of many technologists was how Google — which, up to that point, was known for its prowess in artificial intelligence — could be caught flat-footed when the starter’s gun sounded in the race to bring generative AI to the masses?</p>\n<p>Paul Buchheit, creator of Gmail, suggested some answers to that question in a recent edition of the Y Combinator Startup podcast.</p>\n<p>Buchheit, who left Google in 2006, maintained that after the company’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, began to reduce their roles in Google operations, the development of artificial intelligence began to be tempered by other considerations. “I think it became more about protecting and preserving the search monopoly,” he said on the podcast.</p>\n<p>That slowed their AI advancement substantially, added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore. “Up until that time, they were in a leadership position, then lost it with the refocus,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Tech Companies Surprised</h3>\n<p>Google wasn’t the only tech company surprised by the wild popularity of ChatGPT, but it did have more to lose from the development, noted Ross Rubin, principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City. “Many of the other big tech companies were caught by surprise by ChatGPT, in terms of the popularity and how it would resonate with the broad population,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“But where such a high percentage of Google’s business is driven by search and advertising revenue, it’s more important for them than for Apple or Amazon that they be able to harness generative AI in a way that either protects or expands its search business,” he said.</p>\n<p>“With Amazon, Alexa has never been a revenue driver,” he continued. “It is the face or voice of the company in many contexts. But clearly, Amazon drives much more revenue from AWS and the retail business.”</p>\n<p>“In a similar way, Azure and Windows licensing are much, much bigger revenue streams for Microsoft than search,” he added.</p>\n<p>Buchheit pointed out that Google had good reason to worry about AI <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/gartner-predicts-25-dip-in-search-volumes-by-2026-177921.html\">caving in its search goldmine</a>. AI is an inherently <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/gartner-identifies-12-disruptive-technologies-for-future-business-systems-179684.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disruptive technology</a> because if you actually give people the right answer, they won’t need to click on an entire page full of ads, he explained.</p>\n<p>Google has been aware of that tension between profitability and giving the right answers as far back as 1998, he continued. “There’s always a temptation that if you make your results worse, people will click on more ads,” he said. “<a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/gmail-creator-predicts-ai-will-totally-disrupt-google-search-in-1-to-2-years-177745.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI has the potential to disrupt that.</a>”</p>\n<h3>Perils of Good Search Results</h3>\n<p>“There’s no question that Google remains one of the leaders in AI, but it is true that their focus on revenue and profitability may have hurt their capacity to innovate, as they pressure their AI teams to productize and monetize the technology,” observed Greg Sterling, co-founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nearmedia.co/\">Near Media</a>, a news, commentary, and analysis website.</p>\n<p>He maintained that Google’s focus on revenue growth has already hurt the experience of search users. “And it’s possible that their removal or reduction of AI overview and search is tied to a negative impact on ad clicks,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>In July, Search Engine Land, citing an analysis by enterprise SEO platform BrightEdge, reported a drop in AI overviews in Google searches from 11% to 7% during June.</p>\n<p>“By prioritizing search, Google might have slowed its AI advancements compared to competitors who aggressively pushed AI boundaries, like OpenAI and Microsoft,” said Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>“This strategic pivot likely allowed rivals to catch up or even surpass Google in AI research and applications, particularly in generative models and other cutting-edge AI technologies, potentially weakening Google’s leadership in the AI field over time,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>AI Ad Impact Exaggerated?</h3>\n<p>While there’s a risk that if search results are too good, ad clicks could be reduced, that risk may be exaggerated. “I don’t think generative AI steals much from the ad business,” said Michael Hodel, director of equity research for the media and telecom sector at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“The types of searches that generate ad revenue are those where there isn’t a single answer and where advertisers hope to influence which route the user takes — like, ‘what are some cool new shoes I might like?’“ he told TechNewsWorld. “The question is how ads will surface in a generative AI context?”</p>\n<p>The answer to that question, he continued, lies in a comment by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai at the company’s second-quarter conference call. “[W]e are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses,” Pichai said.</p>\n<p>In addition to being concerned about the impact of generative AI on ad revenues, Buchheit maintained Google was worried about how the technology would play with regulators. AI had the potential to anger regulators because it would only be a matter of time before it said something offensive. “I think they were kind of terrified of that,” he said.</p>\n<p>“So they were just extremely risk-averse,” he explained.</p>\n<h3>Slow Start but Formidable Player</h3>\n<p>If Page and Brin were still running the company, that risk aversion might have been overridden, he continued. “But it takes someone with that level of credibility to really bet the company or to say, ‘Yeah, we’re going to do this thing, and it’s going to cause a lot of problems.’” he said.</p>\n<p>“But I think that if given the chance, Google never would have launched AI,” he contended. “The only reason they launched it is because OpenAI put out ChatGPT, and suddenly, it became a thing that they were forced to do.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“And that also helped them because OpenAI took a lot of those bullets in terms of saying crazy and offensive things,” he added.</p>\n<p>Despite a slow start, Vena asserted that Google is making significant strides in the AI arms race. “Leveraging its vast data resources and deep expertise in machine learning, Google has developed powerful AI technologies like Bard/Gemini and advancements in large language models like PaLM,” he said.</p>\n<p>“While competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft initially gained attention,” he continued, “Google has recently accelerated its AI initiatives, integrating AI more deeply across its products, including search, cloud services, and consumer applications. This renewed focus, coupled with its strategic acquisitions and research, position Google as a formidable player in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Although AI-capable PCs were introduced in the middle of the second quarter, they still captured 14% of global shipments, according to a report released Tuesday by research firm <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.canalys.com/\">Canalys</a>.</p>\n<p>Canalys reported that 8.8 million AI-capable PCs were shipped during the period, 40% running Microsoft Windows and 60% running macOS.</p>\n<p>Canalys defines an AI-capable PC as a desktop or notebook that includes a chipset or block for dedicated AI workloads, such as a neural processing unit (NPU).</p>\n<p>With all major processor vendors’ AI-capable PC roadmaps now well underway, the report noted, the stage is set for a significant ramp-up in device availability and end-user adoption in the second half of 2024 and beyond.</p>\n<p>“The second quarter of 2024 added significant momentum to the expansion of AI-capable PCs,” Canalys Principal Analyst Ishan Dutt said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“June saw the launch of Copilot+ PCs incorporating Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series of chips, based on Arm architecture,” he continued. “While shipment volumes in the quarter were relatively small due to the limited weeks and geographical coverage of availability, the broad commitment of Windows OEMs to adopt these products into their portfolios bodes well for the category’s outlook.”</p>\n<p>“With a strong foundation now set, AI-capable PC shipments are poised to gain further traction in the second half of 2024,” he added.</p>\n<h3>AI-PC Market Growth Driven by Supply</h3>\n<p>Dutt explained that processor vendors and OEMs are set to target a wider base of customers through new product category availability across more price points, while channel partners are signaling a preference for AI-related features in PCs. He noted that close to 60% of respondents in a May poll indicated that they expect customers to favor devices with a Copilot key.</p>\n<p>“The market performance of AI-capable PCs has largely aligned with expectations, and the industry remains on track to ship around 44 million units in 2024 and 103 million units in 2025, according to Canalys forecasts,” he added.</p>\n<p>Mikako Kitagawa, director and analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn., asserted that OEMs have shown a strong commitment to AI-capable PCs. However, she acknowledged to TechNewsWorld, “The AI PC trend is supply-led, not demand-led.”</p>\n<p>“The recent rise of AI-capable PCs represents the hardware industry trying to solve the chicken-and-egg problem by providing a large installed base for application developers to target,” said Dev Nag, CEO and founder of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.querypal.com\">QueryPal</a>, an enterprise chatbot based in San Francisco.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>“There aren’t a ton of mainstream applications that need NPUs yet — as opposed to, say, GPUs — but there are a number of compelling possibilities that these vendors are hoping to kickstart,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Possibilities cited by Nag included local real-time video enhancements for video calls, advanced photo editing, real-time language translation, and productivity enhancements like intelligence document summarization and advanced search on local files.</p>\n<h3>Application Shortage Slowing Adoption</h3>\n<p>“OEMs are cautiously optimistic,” Nag said. “They see the potential for a broad upgrade wave and are also interested in staying strategically aligned with Microsoft.”</p>\n<p>“They’re naturally focused on integrating NPUs into the high-end and business-focused markets first, before the broader consumer market,” he added.</p>\n<p>There were signs of that in the Canalys report, which revealed that AI-capable PC penetration into the above US$800 Windows PC market doubled from Q1 to Q2, 7% to 14%.</p>\n<p>Nag predicted, “We’ll likely see a gradual increase in AI PC market share to the mid to high 20% level next year, but the lack of applications will slow adoption.”</p>\n<p>“If the application market starts to move towards taking advantage of this hardware,” he continued, “we could see the first ‘killer apps’ driving faster adoption in 2025.”</p>\n<p>Much of that early adoption will likely come from the enterprise. “Large enterprises will probably be the fastest segment to adopt AI PCs going forward because many AI tasks will move from the cloud to local,” Kitagawa explained. “Large enterprises prefer that way, making AI PCs more useful.”</p>\n<h3>Dazed and Confused Consumers</h3>\n<p>While enthusiasm for AI-capable PCs has been strong for vendors, it’s been less so for consumers. “So far, consumer reaction to the AI PC has been tepid,” said Andrew Hewitt, a principal analyst with Forrester, a market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.</p>\n<p>He cited a recent Forrester study conducted during this year’s second quarter, which found that more than half of U.S. consumers do not know what an AI PC is.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“There is still considerable confusion when it comes to understanding how the AI PC is different from the traditional PC,” he told TechNewsWorld. “In my opinion, this is because the average consumer is not aware of the nuances between a CPU, GPU, and the newly available neural processing unit [NPU], which is one — but not the only — hallmark of an AI PC.</p>\n<p>“The average user is also likely to associate generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot with an AI PC, rather than a change in the hardware.”</p>\n<p>Nag added that most people who buy Apple laptops are probably unaware that their purchases are AI-capable with Apple’s Neural Engine, let alone considering app compatibility as a driver of selection.</p>\n<p>“Microsoft’s introduction of the Copilot Key for AI-capable PCs earlier this year is likewise not something that the market is clamoring for, yet, but an attempt to lead the market towards a vision,” he said.</p>\n<p>He added that some early adopters have been skeptical about potential gatekeeping around AI-dedicated NPUs when many GPUs are capable of equivalent or even higher AI compute performance. “But outside of those early adopters,” Nag said, “the reaction has been less confusion than inattention. Apps will drive broad user awareness more than hardware.”</p>\n<h3>More Marketing Hype Than Functionality</h3>\n<p>Hewitt agreed that the enterprise will drive most of the adoption of AI PCs. But we don’t see the real opportunity for mass adoption until 2025 when many companies will be undertaking or completing their Windows 10 to 11 migration to meet the end-of-life deadline for Windows 10,” he said.</p>\n<p>“According to our report, we see many of these use cases surrounding personas like creatives, developers, and data scientists who will benefit most from apps that can take advantage of the NPU,” he added.</p>\n<p>HP Newquist, executive director of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aiexhibit.org\">The Relayer Group</a>, a science and technology exhibition company in New York City and author of “The Brain Makers: Genius, Ego &amp; Greed In The Quest For Machines That Think,” argues that, at this stage, the AI PC is a marketing tactic and little more.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Manufacturers are preloading basic PCs with a variety of new AI products, typically apps that have been built on large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT,” he told TechNewsWorld. “In some cases, additional processing power has been added, much like you’d find on gamers’ PCs.”</p>\n<p>“Microsoft’s AI PC offering, which is being touted by companies like Dell and HP, has Copilot integrated with Windows, so it’s essentially part of the operating system,” he explained, “but Copilot is also available on the internet to any Microsoft user, so it’s not necessarily a feature limited to AI PCs.”</p>\n<p>“The inclusion of high-powered AI processors on these machines, which Microsoft calls neural processing units, is more a speed function at this point than an actual AI enhancement,” he continued. “Until more AI apps are able to be run locally — and not rely on massive amounts of cloud power and storage — the AI processors won’t be utilized to their fullest potential. The apps will still be tapping into the internet for much of their processing.”</p>\n<p>“At this stage, building a PC with that kind of processing power is like building an eight-lane highway for mopeds,” he added. “The highway is ready, but the mopeds can’t tear up the roads because they’re not designed for that kind of speed.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I recently had the opportunity to explore two new headphones from Sonos and Heavys. Both showcase distinct features and sound profiles that cater to different listening preferences.</p>\n<p>The Sonos headphones impress with their seamless integration into the brand’s ecosystem. They deliver a rich, immersive audio experience with exceptional build quality.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Heavys headphones stand out for their innovative design and powerful, bass-forward sound, making them a compelling choice for audiophiles seeking an intense auditory experience.</p>\n<p>Both models offer unique advantages, reflecting the evolving landscape of premium headphone offerings.</p>\n<h3>Who Is Heavys?</h3>\n<p>Heavys headphones, designed to maximize music enjoyment for metal enthusiasts, made headlines a few years ago. In early 2022, a Kickstarter campaign initiated by former Sennheiser audio expert Axel Grell launched the Heavys, targeted at heavy metal music lovers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/heavys-headphones.jpg\" alt=\"Heavys Headphones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/heavys-headphones.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/heavys-headphones-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/heavys-headphones-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Heavys headphones (Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>I’m not and will never be a fan of heavy metal. My interest in the Heavys is to see how they would perform with more mainstream pop music devotees like me.</p>\n<p>For clarity, the Heavys were tested on my iPhone 15 Pro Max using Apple Music in lossless and hi-res lossless versions.</p>\n<p>The Heavys are slightly heavier than other over-the-ear headphones due to heavy-duty material and a matte black finish. The brand’s emblem is stenciled in white on both earcups and embossed on the headband.</p>\n<p>Despite their heft, the Heavys have plush ear cushions that make them comfy and tight on the head.</p>\n<h3>Aggressive Design Yet Easy To Use</h3>\n<p>The control switches on the underside of both ear cups are solid and snap when used, but I found them more accessible to manipulate before putting on the headphones. The right ear cup’s ridged volume slider works well on the move.</p>\n<p>A molded carry case and foldable Heavys make travel easy, a key factor as the Apple AirPods Max (my preferred at-home headphone) is simply too large to travel with. The AirPods Max ear cups don’t swivel, so wearing them around your neck can be awkward.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Heavys uses eight drivers to deliver songs directly to your ears, creating an optimal sound experience for all music genres. The headphones also contain five mics, which are critical feature attributes for smartphone conversations.</p>\n<p>I liked using the amusingly labeled Hell Blocker Active Noise Cancelling when walking on busy main roads during my morning runs. Heavys supports Bluetooth 5.1 BLE and USB-C/analog, and a full charge lasted near its advertised 50-hour battery life spec.</p>\n<p>Sadly, unlike most other headphones, the Heavys lacks a dedicated app for EQ, firmware upgrades, and other features. Heavys says a standalone app is under development and should be released by the end of the year.</p>\n<h3>Heavys Delivers Superior Sound Quality</h3>\n<p>Designed for metal music lovers, sound quality is a paramount feature. As mentioned, I tried the Heavys using an iPhone with Apple Music in lossless and hi-res lossless modes.</p>\n<p>The out-of-the-box experience was somewhat muffled and too bass-heavy for my tastes, so I had to alter the EQ settings, which quickly enhanced the sound to my liking.</p>\n<p>When turning on, off, activating Hell Blocker ANC, or pairing, a deep, rumbling voice strongly reminded me of the Duke Nukem character in “Mortal Kombat.” It’s clear that the Heavys design team has a sense of humor.</p>\n<p>My musical genre test suite included Frank Sinatra, Barbara Streisand, and Tony Bennett standards and musical shows like “Man of La Mancha,” “Wicked,” “Promises, Promises,” “Camelot,” “1776,” and “They’re Playing Our Song.”</p>\n<p>I found the audio experience quite immersive, with clear, balanced sound. The famous overture from “Man of La Mancha” was so clear that I could hear the separation of instruments in each ear cup, which is precisely how it was musically arranged in 1965.</p>\n<h3>The Verdict on Heavys Headphones</h3>\n<p>Though Heavys is new to the market, at $269, it represents a compelling value compared to more expensive alternatives like Apple’s AirPods Max.</p>\n<p>The Heavys also excel from a design standpoint. I am disappointed that it currently lacks a smartphone app for firmware updates, which will undoubtedly optimize the sound in the future and provide an easier way to customize the audio experience. Putting those caveats aside, the Heavys are a welcome addition to the crowded over-the-ear headphone market — even if you’re not a heavy metal music fan.</p>\n<p>Currently, Heavys can only be purchased directly from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.heavys.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a>.</p>\n<h3>Sonos Ace Arrives on the Scene</h3>\n<p>After years of anticipation, Sonos’ debut headphones have finally launched.</p>\n<p>These new headphones from the acclaimed wireless home theater system manufacturer incorporate many Sonos hallmarks, including elite craftsmanship, remarkable sound quality, and seamless connectivity with the brand’s latest soundbars.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/sonos-ace-headphones.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos Ace headphones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/sonos-ace-headphones.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/sonos-ace-headphones-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/sonos-ace-headphones-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Sonos Ace headphones (Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>Upscale features such as active noise cancellation, high-end audio support, and spatial audio with Dolby Atmos add to their flair and help justify their steep price tag of $449.</p>\n<p>These headphones sound as beautiful as they look. The Ace does have a few functional blemishes I’ll point out, though Sonos may resolve these issues over time.</p>\n<p>Particularly if you’re a proud member of the Sonos ecosystem, as I am, you’ll find the Ace to be a worthy pickup. Let me elaborate.</p>\n<h3>Impeccable Sound</h3>\n<p>The Sonos Ace offers audio quality rivaled only by the Apple AirPods Max. These headphones, by default, offer Sonos’ signature sound. It’s detailed, nicely balanced and vibrant. Midrange reproduction ranks among the best in the category. The bass is deep, and the highs are rich.</p>\n<p>The bright electric guitar and infectious Burt Bachrach synths from the overture of “Promises, Promises” sounded as compelling as they did on a live Broadway production I saw in 2010. Vocal clarity was equally satisfying and had me privately belting the passionate title song.</p>\n<p>Active noise cancellation (ANC) significantly boosts the bass; turning it off does the opposite. The Sonos app has an EQ to customize the sound. The loudness setting helps make the bass and treble more effective at low volume.</p>\n<p>High-end audio codes like AAC (Apple iOS/macOS) and SBC (Google Android) run smoothly and produce stable playback on the best music streaming services.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Qualcomm’s aptX Adaptive/Lossless does a fantastic job of dynamically scaling Bluetooth audio to divulge more nuance in recordings. Tidal tracks offer unbeatable performance, and the platform’s desktop features help enhance output when in wired mode.</p>\n<p>The included auxiliary and USB-C cables get you lossless audio on compatible devices. I was thrilled with the results, granted the midrange was overemphasized on several tracks.</p>\n<p>Sonos’ 3D sound format is superb and supports dynamic head-tracking to create an encapsulating virtual soundscape. The spatial audio content on Apple Music and Apple TV sounded natural and immersive, and motion detection was accurate.</p>\n<p>Sonos developed two exclusive features for the Ace. The first is TV Audio Swap, which switches audio between a Sonos soundbar and the Ace headphones. Then there’s TrueCinema, which uses a Sonos soundbar to map out your space and optimize the Ace’s acoustics for your room.</p>\n<h3>Sleek and Stylish Design</h3>\n<p>Sonos speakers are some of the swankiest home products and double as fancy décor. The Ace is no different. Placing them on a headphone stand in your living room will earn you coolness points. Their clean and minimalist appearance is on brand. Refined materials like the dark aluminum yokes and plush leather padding on the headband and earpads make for a comfy, well-fitting design. The sleek matte finish and slim microphone grilles are nice touches, too.</p>\n<p>Sonos showed some creativity with its control setup. On the right earcup is a content key that provides a springy, tactile feedback experience every time you move the slider up or down to control volume and a satisfying click when you press it to pause or play. There’s also a button to enable ANC/voice control and a button for power/pairing.</p>\n<p>The slim carry case is handsomely crafted. Sonos says it’s built from 75% recycled plastic bottles, but the felt material on the outside feels premium. The headphones sit nicely in their groove, and the separate felt pocket conveniently stores all accessories without taking up extra space. These headphones will be a pleasure to travel with during my next business trip.</p>\n<h3>Intuitive Ecosystem Integration</h3>\n<p>Sonos’ obvious intention is for the Ace to work seamlessly with your other Sonos products. Thanks to features like TV Audio Swap and TrueCinema, the Sonos ecosystem allows the Ace to work with your Sonos home theater. Although, if you don’t own a Sonos speaker, these benefits will not appeal to you.</p>\n<p>Regardless, TV Audio Swap worked well for me while watching blockbuster films and sports events alone, especially after other family members retired for the night. Sound quality isn’t compromised, and it is undoubtedly much more convenient than manually pairing and re-pairing things once it’s time to put headphones on.</p>\n<p>TrueCinema is Ace’s killer feature. It creates a personal 3D sound profile for the headphones by having your Sonos bar map your listening environment. It sounds promising and could be a huge selling point when it’s finally released in the coming weeks.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The Sonos Arc is the only device to support these two features, but a future software update is said to bring them to the Beam (Gen 2), Beam, and Ray.</p>\n<p>Outside the Sonos platform, the Ace works well with iOS/macOS and Android devices. Apple MFi and one-tap Google Fast Pair deliver instantaneous pairing no matter what phone you have. Multipoint technology is also onboard to pair the headphones with two audio sources simultaneously.</p>\n<p>However, it’s worth noting that the Ace is not Wi-Fi compatible and doesn’t need to be set up through the Sonos app. Granted, the latter does help when troubleshooting and places a few features at your fingertips.</p>\n<h3>Adequate Noise Cancellation, Call Quality</h3>\n<p>In my experience, the Ace has exquisite noise cancellation, though it’s not quite as good as the Apple AirPods Max or Bose QC Ultra. However, these noise-canceling headphones did block out a vast amount of incidental sound.</p>\n<p>I found the technology helpful in silencing common household distractions such as kitchen appliances, TVs, and outdoor disturbances. Loud noises, such as construction tools and sirens, caught my attention.</p>\n<p>Strong wind resistance kept the soundstage free of harsh whooshing effects. Aware mode was decent for monitoring my environment, but the mics struggled with vocal capture. With future firmware updates, I expect the Ace noise cancellation to become as good as competitive headphones.</p>\n<h3>Battery Life Lower Than Advertised</h3>\n<p>Sonos rates the Ace’s battery life at 30 hours with ANC on. My tested battery life was closer to 25 hours, outpacing the long-in-the-tooth Apple AirPods Max. There was a three-hour drop when using ANC. Spatial audio brought playtime down to about 20 hours.</p>\n<p>However, I’m glad to report that Sonos offers some of the strongest quick charging in the category. A three-minute charge provides three hours of use, something you’ll value when traveling.</p>\n<h3>Buggy Companion App</h3>\n<p>Sadly, the Sonos app occasionally froze or didn’t acknowledge the headphones being paired to my smartphone. When recognized, the app provided access to several perks: a battery level indicator, EQ, and toggle controls for all the main functions.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the EQ is pedestrian and limits adjustments to bass, treble, and balance output between channels. Like every other competitor, Sonos should have developed multiple EQs.</p>\n<p>I also encountered an issue where a software update meant to be a 10-minute download took about 30 minutes to complete, presumably because it was the product’s first major software upgrade post-launch.</p>\n<h3>Ace Better With Other Sonos Speakers</h3>\n<p>The biggest challenge that most consumers will face is that the Ace’s coolest sound features are tied to the Sonos platform, and they only work with the Sonos soundbar at the moment: the Arc.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>These perks will eventually be available on the Beam and Ray soundbars, but if you don’t currently have a Sonos soundbar, the Ace will simply be less functional.</p>\n<h3>Premium Price</h3>\n<p>It would have been in Sonos’ best interest to launch the $449 Ace at a more competitive price point. These headphones are more expensive than the $399 Bose QC Ultra, probably the best noise-canceling that is frequently on sale.</p>\n<p>The Ace does have a lower retail price than Apple’s $549 AirPods Max, but those headphones also see frequent discounts to as low as $429. If Sonos priced Ace in the $399 range, discounted pricing would make it a no-brainer.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Admittedly, I’m a Sonos guy, and I appreciate the value these headphones provide. I’ve invested heavily in the company’s smart wireless audio ecosystem for years. The sound quality is undeniably excellent, and active noise cancellation is impressive.</p>\n<p>As a Sonos fan, these headphones are a game-changer for me because they’ll be easy to travel with, something I can’t do with the Apple AirPods Max due to its bulk.</p>\n<p>Integration into the Sonos ecosystem will improve, and I value that. If you’re not a Sonos user, there are less expensive alternatives. But for me, the Ace is stunning in design, sound, and integration, and Sonos’ first foray into the headphones space is a solid and noteworthy achievement.</p>\n<p>The Sonos Ace headphones are available directly from <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-ace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonos</a>, Amazon, and major electronic retailers like Best Buy.</p>\n",

Duncan said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“While the management of their organization’s D&amp;A operating model is increasing year over year, no other role than the CDAO has the responsibility of many of the key enablers of AI, which include data governance, D&amp;A ethics, and data and AI literacy,” Duncan continued.</p>\n<p>“The scope of responsibilities of the CDAO role has also expanded as budget and resource constraints become even more of a problem,” he added.</p>\n<h3>AI As Musical Star Analogy</h3>\n<p>The survey results, released in advance of Gartner’s Data &amp; Analytics Summit to be held in London in May, noted that AI has become part of the duties of a majority of CDAOs, with 58% saying AI is within their scope of responsibilities, an increase from 34% in 2023.</p>\n<p>“A lot of organizations, especially in the private sector, are redefining their entire business model based on AI, whether it’s going to be for the value of automation, operational excellence or forging new business paths,” said Gartner Senior Director Analyst Donna Medeiros.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of industries that have been using AI for a long time, but gen AI, in particular, has been undergoing a lot of pilots,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Another research firm, Forrester, pointed out in its report “AI Is Ready For The Spotlight, But Data And Analytics Determine If It Shines” that “outputs from AI technologies will only be good as the data that goes into them, so business and technology leaders must embrace best practices for data and analytics to maximize the value from their artificial intelligence.”</p>\n<p>“If generative AI is the star actor in ‘Business Technology: The Musical, 2024,’ data and analytics leaders are the stage managers,” noted the report, authored by Forrester analyst Zeid Khater with Aaron Katz, Kim Herrington, Jayesh Chaurasia, Brandon Purcell, Noel Yuhanna, Evan Megan, and Jen Barton.</p>\n<h3>Setting Stage for Success</h3>\n<p>Before the star technology can deliver value for its audience of stakeholders and customers, data and analytics leaders must enable the people, processes, and platforms to set the stage for success, Forrester continued.</p>\n<p>“Forward-thinking data and analytics teams know that outputs from AI technologies will only be as good as the data that goes into them, and they will embrace data platforms and data quality practices to support [large language models] and unstructured data as well as data skills training to put their staff in the best position to deliver value with new AI technologies,” Khater wrote.</p>\n<p>“The work that data and analytics teams do behind the scenes will determine whether new AI technologies flop or shine in the spotlight when they hit center stage,” he added.</p>\n<p>Forrester emphasized that improving data quality allows machine learning models to accurately identify underlying patterns, thereby improving prediction accuracy.</p>\n<p>“When organizations prioritize data quality through rigorous metrics, assessments, continuous monitoring, and improvement, they not only enhance model reliability but also reduce the risk of biased or erroneous conclusions,” Khater noted. “This improvement in model accuracy translates into cost savings, improved business outcomes, and a competitive advantage.”</p>\n<h3>Need for Metrics</h3>\n<p>While metrics will be important for advancing AI in the enterprise, Gartner found CDAOs lagging in that area. It noted that only 49% of surveyed CDAOs have established business outcome-driven metrics that allow stakeholders to track D&amp;A value. In addition, 34% have not established business outcome metrics for D&amp;A.</p>\n<p>“Forty-nine percent is low because it means that less than half understand that they need to work with the business to put metrics in place to demonstrate the value of what they’re accomplishing because invariably they’re going to be asked, ‘What did we get for this investment?'” Medeiros said.</p>\n<p>“The D&amp;A leader can’t do this in a vacuum,” she continued. Their peers are going to know what’s important to the business and what the [key performance indicators] are so they can get to the actual metrics.”</p>\n<p>“CDAOs need to work with all business lines to estimate for all use cases and projects what the impact on return on investment will be based on metrics established during planning time to understand what they achieve,” she explained. “D&amp;A leaders need to engage with business folks to establish metrics and get well above the 49%.”</p>\n<p>“CDAOs also have to be comfortable talking about business discipline,” she added. “That’s not easy for many because they haven’t been in the D&amp;A leader role for very long. It’s still a relatively recent role for most.”</p>\n<p>According to the survey, only 22% of the CDAOs have been in their jobs for five years or more. And those in those jobs aren’t looking to stay in them, with 56% of the surveyed CDAOs saying they were looking for another job. “That’s because there’s so many demands on that position,” Medeiros said.</p>\n<h3>Power Play Needed</h3>\n<p>The Gartner survey also found that expanding responsibilities entails a significant cost for CDAOs. Among CDAOs who report a year-over-year increase in their function’s funding, 46% still report budget constraints as a challenge.</p>\n<p>“CDAOs who present better business cases to CFOs receive better and quicker funding for their D&amp;A initiatives. They also gain higher executive buy-in,” Duncan said.</p>\n<p>Gartner noted that CDAOs need to grow their power and influence to make things happen. They also must understand the organization’s value levers and pain points end to end to showcase their value to the board.</p>\n<p>“If not, by 2026, 75% of CDAOs who fail to make organization-wide influence and measurable impact their top priority will be assimilated into technology functions,” Duncan predicted.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Last week, I took part in a radio show on AI electric cars of the future. It was based on an <a href=\"https://www.topgear.com/car-news/tech/nine-ways-artificial-intelligence-making-its-way-cars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> from the BBC’s TopGear, which used to be my favorite car program, but they changed hosts, so I rarely watch it now.</p>\n<p>It got me thinking about how fast things are moving and how much misinformation is out there regarding how and when autonomous driving will be viable (it isn’t yet, regardless of what Elon Musk says), the state of electric vehicles today, the very low probability for hydrogen to replace batteries, and where else AI will be introduced into our cars.</p>\n<p>What is particularly interesting and concerning is how fast China is moving with these technologies and how much better, faster, and cheaper its electric cars are, even though it currently has a serious quality control problem.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, the current state of EVs, and the role of AI in the automotive industry. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week: an automotive cheat tool my wife bought me that I am impressed with.</p>\n<h3>Electric Car Status</h3>\n<p>The pressure on electric car sales has been increasing rapidly of late, mainly because demand for these cars has declined, slowing market growth. This slowing is due to three things: continued quality problems, particularly with Tesla’s new Cybertruck, some of Musk’s political views, and a lack of marketing execution.</p>\n<p>As a result, Tesla has taken a hard hit in terms of sales momentum. Given it’s the biggest player, for now, in the electric car market, its problems are having a huge impact on the industry.</p>\n<p>But Tesla isn’t alone. Virtually all of the traditional carmakers have had issues pivoting to electrics. Even though electric cars should be automotive appliances that rarely break, they have been breaking a lot — so much so that their repair rate adjusted for volume is far higher than that of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, resulting in recent surveys indicating that more than half of the current electric car owners want to go back to ICE vehicles.</p>\n<p>Additionally, several automakers who indicated they would be 100% electric by 2030 are rethinking this move and pivoting to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).</p>\n<p>However, PHEVs have their own problems as they effectively have two power trains, which means massively increased complexity and highly varied usage models. What I’m getting at is that most of the newer PHEVs with around a 40-mile electric range won’t use their gas engine much, but gas engines need to be run, particularly if they are using ethanol, which can gum up the injectors and cause the engine to fail if the gas gets too old.</p>\n<p>Here is a piece of advice: If you have a PHEV, find a gas station that sells gas without ethanol. Use that gas, and you won’t have as big a problem. By the way, the same goes for motorized equipment like snow blowers that are left unused for much of the year.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11244:a-nice-q225-970x250-intcelebkb cc: --></div>\n<p>At the same time, the U.S. and much of Europe agreed to switch from the current plug standards for electric cars to Tesla’s plug standard. This change will open Tesla superchargers to everyone and reduce much of the confusion surrounding which plug goes to which car.</p>\n<p>The Tesla standard is now called the North American Charging Standard, or NACS. By 2026, most electric cars in the U.S. should have converted to that standard. Older electric cars can use an adapter, but don’t bother buying one until your car gets the software update that will allow it to talk to a Tesla Supercharger.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you haven’t tried both types of chargers, the old U.S. standard required a fee and an ATM-like experience: you first had to enable the charger with an app, and then it might allow your car to charge — although often the chargers were broken. Tesla drivers, on the other hand, could just plug in.</p>\n<p>However, Tesla chargers have issues with gas-powered cars parking in the charging spaces, Tesla drivers leaving their vehicles longer than necessary, people breaking the chargers, and theft (which isn’t only a Tesla charger problem).</p>\n<p>As I see it, the problem is that we began this shift to EVs before we had the needed technology. Lithium-ion batteries were developed after decades of slow progress in battery technology for electric devices like cell phones, iPods, and laptops. Plus, you might recall many of those batteries catching fire, a problem that continues to plague us.</p>\n<p>Lithium and cobalt, both used in current lithium-ion batteries, are challenging to mine. Lithium burns hot enough to melt aluminum and some types of steel, as I discovered when a battery nearly burned my house down after melting the steel screws on its containment chamber. Additionally, lithium batteries break down rapidly when overheated, such as during fast charging.</p>\n<h3>Big Changes Coming</h3>\n<p>Over the last 30 years, we have ramped up battery development massively. By 2027, we should have viable alternatives to lithium-ion, including solid-state batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and some new lithium versions (cobalt mining is also pretty nasty).</p>\n<p>These coming technologies promise ranges of 750 miles or more, 15-year, 1M-mile service life, and other advantages that would make the need for charging away from your home infinitely less pronounced because how often do you drive over 750 miles?</p>\n<p>These new batteries, coupled with ever more powerful chargers, should result in sub-10-minute charging times without the current danger of prematurely aging your batteries. China’s XPeng already has a car with a near 500-mile range at a really attractive price, suggesting it is becoming as significant a threat to existing carmakers as Japan once was. Until now, Tesla has had a considerable range and price advantage in this market.</p>\n<p>So electric propulsion will become more convenient and competitive with gas cars, but what about AI?</p>\n<p>Autonomous cars will have five levels. Level 5 means they never need a driver. Currently, most cars are hovering at Level 2+, which pretty much entails the ability to avoid things like the car in front of you.</p>\n<p>Here is a video that does a nice job of explaining the different levels.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BMW Fully Car Autonomous Automated Driving (LEVEL 5)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GA_NKVBpcVQ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Mercedes has started rolling out cars equipped with Level 3 systems, but only in Nevada and California. Level 4 systems will arrive around 2027, and level 5 systems are due around 2030.</p>\n<p>But driving the car isn’t just where AI will play. In other areas, restrictions against using the technology are not tied to whether the technology is mature enough yet to avoid accidents and deaths. In-car AI digital assistants are coming. Nvidia has been developing this technology for some time. In 2021, they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zKAKgc7Ecs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">showcased</a> what an in-car digital assistant might look like and how it would work.</p>\n<p>One of the big announcements with electric and gas cars today is that even within the same brand, the controls may be vastly different. There are advanced features like automatic parking that people don’t use because they either don’t know how to or don’t trust them. Imagine being able to ask the car in natural language to do what you need to be done, like “Please park behind the car on my right,” or “Surprise me and take me to a new place to eat that I’d like.”</p>\n<p>Other advantages are that when there is a problem, it could tell you what the problem is and whether it needs immediate attention, unlike the current “fix engine” light that can mean nothing serious or pull the heck over right now and get out of the car.</p>\n<p>I watched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOdW140K8a4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> earlier today showing people using jumper cables to try to get a car air conditioner to work. But an in-car AI digital assistant could have said that their air conditioner needed servicing and what that would mean, and it didn’t mean hooking up jumper cables and then driving down the road with them on.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to know about problems before you get stuck someplace, or what it means when a light comes on you’ve never seen before? This happened to me yesterday when a light showing a foot and a pedal popped up. It’s meant to suggest you slow down, but that same light can mean different things on other cars. Some people get confused by these lights. Simply being able to ask what the notification means would be incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>Add to that, being able to help you select entertainment content, alert you to approaching dangers (for me right now, forest fire alerts would be really handy), and get information from cars in front of me about approaching hazards like black ice road conditions. If you’ve never experienced black ice, I have. It’s no fun at all, and it isn’t clear that sensors in even autonomous cars can see it yet, so getting an early warning would be incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>Finally, over time, the car would get to know you and better adjust to your unique needs, which might change between times of day and days of the week. For instance, you might like the financial reports on the way to work but comedy or soft jazz coming home. Current car technology will adjust between drivers, but next-generation technology will go much further.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>I expect most of the current drama about electric vehicles will be fully resolved by 2030, and on higher-end cars well before that.</p>\n<p>In addition, the coming wave of AI technology will allow us to create a deeper relationship with our vehicles. Since generative AI is conversational, imagine having discussions with a car on a long drive while the car keeps you far safer than you can keep yourself. AI doesn’t get distracted, have substance abuse problems or sudden medical conditions, and when vehicles can talk to each other, they can avoid human-driven cars that are having issues and potentially reduce accidents by over 90%.</p>\n<p>The question becomes: once the car is smart and can drive itself, will you need to own one, or would you instead subscribe to a car service, like Uber, without the driver and save the money you’d spend on your car for other things? The younger generations already avoid driving successfully, so while those of us of a certain age may be tied to ownership, they are not.</p>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>I love driving, but I’m also willing to use this new technology so I can enjoy events without worrying I may have had too much to drink (I don’t drink when I’m driving) and enjoy the company as much as those riding with me seem to.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the future of electric cars with internal digital assistants is coming, ready or not.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Carly On-board Diagnostic Scanner</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-OBDII-scanner.jpg\" alt=\"Carly OBDII scanner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-OBDII-scanner.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-OBDII-scanner-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-OBDII-scanner-768x280.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>I have several on-board diagnostics (OBD) readers, but the problem is that you can’t update them. You need to buy a new reader whenever you get a new car, and even with the reader, the information it supplies doesn’t always tell you how to fix the problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mycarly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carly</a>, which consists of a wireless OBDII reader, an app, and a subscription, can automatically fix some things, provide access to features that typically available only to dealers, and, with its advanced service, offer information on how to fix the problems it identifies.</p>\n<p>You can enable Carly for a single car or all brands for around $76 with the premium package. Right now, that package is $10 cheaper than the basic package for a promotion. To cover all brands, it is around $34 more — allowing you to configure your car and read codes. But if you want help understanding the codes, the cost jumps another $36.</p>\n<p>On top of this, you’ll need to pay for a subscription that can vary between $9 and $20 a month, depending on how much service you get. Still, the information provided to the home mechanic is invaluable and, so far, well worth the expense because mechanic costs are pretty steep these days. So Carly can save you a ton of money.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-app-screens.jpg\" alt=\"Carly app screens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-app-screens.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-app-screens-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Carly-app-screens-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>These app screens illustrate how Carly connects drivers with the data inside their vehicles, enabling them to make informed decisions at every stage of car ownership, from purchasing and maintenance to customization.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Carly enabled me to activate features on my Audi TTS that I didn’t know existed. On my Audi E-Tron GT (electric), it not only enabled some new features but also helped me diagnose and correct an issue with a sensor that was unplugged during wrapping, something that would have otherwise taken hours to diagnose and fix.</p>\n<p>Carly is the smartest OBDII reader I’ve found, and likely a precursor to one of the AI features I expect to come with the approaching wave of AI-driven electric cars, making it my Product of the Week.</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The images featured in the Product of the Week section are credited to Carly Solutions.</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Google announced on Tuesday that it’s joining the AI laptop party by baking new smart features into its new generation of Chromebook Plus computers.</p>\n<p>The new features include “Help Me Write,” AI-generated videoconferencing backgrounds, Magic Editor for photos, and direct access to Google’s gen AI agent Gemini directly from a Chromebook’s home screen.</p>\n<p>Help Me Write uses AI to help a user create text from scratch using a prompt or rewriting existing text to change its tone, modify its length, or recast it entirely.</p>\n<p>The background feature will work with any videoconferencing app and includes a variety of prompts to build backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Magic Editor is accessible within the Google Photos app. Users can edit objects in a photo by tapping or circling them, then dragging them to reposition or resize them with a pinch. In addition, contextual suggestions can be used to improve the lighting and background in a photo.</p>\n<p>On the new Chromebook Plus, Gemini can be called up with a tap of an icon on the home screen. Google is also offering new Chromebook Plus users a 12-month free trial of its advanced Google One AI Premium plan. It features access to Gemini Advanced, 2TB of storage, and Gemini in Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and more.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Chromebook Plus, now with Gemini\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VgAQAZjr_L8\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>“This is about Google embracing AI and defending its primacy as a way to access information and get things done online, which has been challenged by OpenAI and Microsoft’s investment in AI,” said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.</p>\n<p>“As Google develops these AI tools, it makes sense that they’re going to deploy them on their main platforms, Android and Chromebooks,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Rejuvenation Needed</h3>\n<p>Google had to do something to rejuvenate the Chromebook category, maintained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas. “The Chromebook experience has become long in the tooth,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Chromebook Plus laptops are a step forward for the Chromebook category, but I think the Microsoft/Qualcomm approach has a big advantage,” he added.</p>\n<p>Last week, Microsoft announced its Copilot+ laptops powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, which include powerful neural processing units (NPUs) to optimize AI operations.</p>\n<p>“The Chromebook experience has always been a cloud experience,” Vena explained. “The path that Microsoft and Qualcomm are going down is to build AI into their chips so you have a better AI experience locally than in the cloud. You can run a lot of this AI stuff locally without having to depend on an internet connection.”</p>\n<p>“The other advantage is security,” he added. “No matter how secure Google says its cloud is, there’s no substitute for doing things locally.”</p>\n<h3>Unprecedented AI Integration</h3>\n<p>Rubin noted that Google’s announcement does not compare to Recall, the signature feature of the CoPilot+ laptops.</p>\n<p>Recall enables users to find information they’ve previously encountered on their PCs via natural language and contextual search. For example, a user could ask CoPilot+ to “Find an article I read last week about Dr. Who,” and it would. Images and screenshots can be found, too, simply by describing them.

      "content": "<p>ChatGPT and the rapid adoption of generative AI have pushed chief information security officers (CISOs) to the limit, with employees testing these tools in the workplace.</p>\n<p>A survey released earlier this year found that few businesses view this threat vector seriously enough to already have a third-party security cyber risk management solution in place. While 94% of CISOs are concerned with third-party cybersecurity threats — including 17% who view it as a top priority — only 3% have already implemented a third-party cyber risk management solution at their organizations, and 33% plan to do so this year.</p>\n<p>Security risk management software firm <a href=\"https://panorays.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Panorays</a> shed new light on the worsening network security problems workers cause. This internal threat occurs when employees use their organization’s network to experiment with generative AI and other AI tools.</p>\n<p>According to the research, 65% of CISOs expect the third-party cyber risk management budget to increase. Of those respondents, 40% said it would increase from 1% to 10% this year. The report also revealed that CISOs at very large enterprises (73%) are more concerned about third-party cybersecurity threats than mid-size enterprises (47%). Only 7% of CISOs said they were not worried at all.</p>\n<p>“CISOs understand the threat of third-party cybersecurity vulnerabilities, but a gap exists between this awareness and implementing proactive measures,” said Panorays CEO Matan Or-El.</p>\n<p>He warned that empowering CISOs to fortify defenses by analyzing and addressing gaps swiftly is crucial in navigating the current cyber landscape. With the speed of AI development, bad actors will continue to leverage this technology for data breaches, operational disruptions, and more.</p>\n<h3>Overlooked Challenges Increasing Cybersecurity Risks</h3>\n<p>The top challenge CISOs see in fixing third-party risk management matters is complying with new regulations for third-party risk management, according to 20% of the CISOs responding.</p>\n<p>A majority of CISOs are confident that AI solutions can improve third-party security management. However, other cyber experts not referenced in the Panorays report argue that AI is too nascent to provide that solution reliably.</p>\n<p>Other challenges include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicating the business influence of third-party risk management: 19%</li>\n<li>Not enough resources to manage risk in the growing supply chain: 18%</li>\n<li>AI-based third-party breaches increasing: 17%</li>\n<li>No visibility to Shadow IT usage in their company: 16%</li>\n<li>Prioritizing the risk assessment efforts based on criticality: 10%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Confronting regulatory changes and escalating third-party cyber risks is paramount,” continued Or-El. “Despite resource constraints and rising AI-related breaches, increased budget allocation towards cyber risk management is a positive step in the right direction.”</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Reducing Third-Party Security Risks</h3>\n<p>Jasson Casey, CEO of cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://www.beyondidentity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beyond Identity</a>, agreed that access to AI tools can expose companies to sophisticated attacks. These tools can be manipulated to reveal proprietary information or serve as entry points for cyberthreats.</p>\n<p>“The probabilistic nature of AI models means they can be tricked into bypassing security measures, highlighting the importance of rigorous security practices and the need for AI tools that prioritize privacy and data protection,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Casey added that Shadow IT, particularly the unauthorized use of AI tools, significantly undermines organizational cybersecurity efforts. It increases the risk of data breaches and complicates incident response and compliance efforts.</p>\n<p>“To combat the challenges posed by shadow IT, organizations must encourage transparency, provide secure alternatives to popular AI tools, and implement strict yet adaptable policies that guide the use of AI within the enterprise,” he offered.</p>\n<p>Organizations can better manage the risks associated with these unauthorized technologies by addressing the root causes of shadow IT, such as the lack of available, approved tools that meet employee needs. CISOs must provide secure, approved AI solutions that mitigate the risk of information leakage.</p>\n<p>They can reduce reliance on external, less secure AI applications by offering in-house AI tools that respect privacy and data integrity. Casey noted that fostering a security-conscious culture and ensuring that all AI tool usage aligns with organizational policies are crucial steps in curbing the proliferation of shadow IT.</p>\n<h3>Balancing Innovation and Security</h3>\n<p>While that formula for fixing may sound simple, making it happen is one of the biggest obstacles CISOs face today. Among the most formidable challenges CISOs face is the rapid pace of technological advancement and the innovative tactics employed by cyber adversaries.</p>\n<p>“Balancing the drive for innovation with the need for comprehensive security measures, especially in the face of evolving AI technologies and the shadow IT phenomenon, requires constant vigilance and adaptability. Moreover, overcoming security fatigue among employees and encouraging a proactive security posture remain significant hurdles,” Casey noted.</p>\n<p>The most significant increases in the usage and adoption of gen AI and other AI tools are in sectors that stand to gain from data analysis, automation, and enhanced decision-making processes. These include finance, health care, and technology.</p>\n<p>“This uptick necessitates a more nuanced understanding of AI’s benefits and risks, urging organizations to adopt secure and ethical AI practices proactively,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Mitigating Risks of Shadow IT Exposure</h3>\n<p>IT leaders must prioritize establishing AI-centric security training, according to Casey. Workers need to recognize that every interaction with AI could potentially train its core models.</p>\n<p>By implementing phishing-resistant authentication, organizations can shift from traditional phishing security training to educating employees on the proper use of AI tools. This focus on education will form a robust defense against inadvertent data breaches and provide a good starting point for defending against third-party cyber assaults.</p>\n<p>A worthwhile follow-up for CISOs is developing dynamic policies that account for the evolving nature of AI tools and the associated security risks. Policies must limit confidential and proprietary inputs to public AI services, mitigating the risk of exposing these details.</p>\n<p>“Additionally, these policies should be adaptive, regularly reviewed, and updated to remain effective against new threats,” Casey pointed out. “By understanding and legislating against the misuse of AI, including potential jailbreaks, CISOs can safeguard their organizations against emerging threats.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>With the announcement on Tuesday of its low-cost, on-road delivery robot, a San Francisco Bay Area startup believes it has the solution to the high cost of delivering products ordered online.</p>\n<p>The four-wheel robot made by <a href=\"https://www.vayurobotics.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vayu Robotics</a> eschews expensive LiDAR technology typically used by on-road driverless vehicles in favor of a transformer-based mobility foundation model with a powerful passive sensor.</p>\n<p>LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances and create high-resolution images of objects and environments. It emits laser pulses and detects the reflected signals, allowing accurate 3D mapping and analysis of targets.</p>\n<p>“People use LiDAR because traditional cameras have known failure modes in low light and harsh weather, and so on,” explained Vayu CEO and Co-founder Anand Gopalan.</p>\n<p>“But with LiDAR, you always have the trade-off between making something that’s high-performance but very difficult and expensive to manufacture or making low-performance LiDAR that’s very easy to manufacture,” he told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>“When you put LiDAR on a robot, the cost goes up by $10,000 to $15,000,” he said. “That’s prohibitively expensive for applications like delivery.”</p>\n<h3>Promising Innovation</h3>\n<p>Vayu explained in a statement that traditional mobile robots rely on costly LiDAR sensors and software modules built to do one task at a time, leading to expensive hardware and fragile software that is unable to handle new scenarios.</p>\n<p>Vayu’s foundation model, the machine learning technology at the heart of generative AI, combined with a powerful passive sensor, eliminates the need for LiDAR. As a result, Vayu’s delivery robot operates autonomously without pre-mapping the roads it intends to drive on. It can navigate inside stores, on city streets, and unload packages on driveways or porches, carrying up to 100 pounds at speeds under 20 miles per hour.</p>\n<p>According to the company, its delivery robots are already being debuted in real-world applications. It added that it recently signed a substantial commercial agreement with a large e-commerce player, which it didn’t identify by name, to deploy 2,500 robots to enable ultra-fast goods delivery, with similar commercial customers in the pipeline.</p>\n<div><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/988589186?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The team is also working with a leading global robotics manufacturer to replace LiDAR sensors with Vayu’s sensing technology for other robotic applications, it added.</p>\n<p>“Overall, Vayu presents a promising innovation in the field of autonomous delivery, leveraging AI and cost-effective sensor technology to offer a competitive alternative to traditional LiDAR-based systems,” Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in Las Vegas, told the E-Commerce Times.</p>\n<p>“However,” he continued, “it must navigate several challenges and risks to achieve widespread adoption and success.”</p>\n<h3>Could Accelerate Robot Deployments</h3>\n<p>Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., added that if Vayu’s technology works at scale, it would significantly reduce the cost of this class of robots and accelerate their deployment in areas where the robots make sense.</p>\n<p>“LiDAR works, but it is also a relatively expensive sensor, and you need a number of them on every vehicle for adequate coverage,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “The navigation system is the most expensive system on a delivery robot, and this would reduce the cost of such a system significantly.”</p>\n<p>While LiDAR sensors are more expensive than using cameras and radar, active sensors also have significant safety advantages in being able to measure where objects are around the vehicle accurately, noted Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://guidehouseinsights.com/\">Guidehouse Insights</a>, a market intelligence company in Detroit.</p>\n<p>“It’s possible to use cameras only, but they need to be configured in stereo pairs to get accurate range measurements,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “When each camera is facing a different direction, and you are relying on AI inference, it will never be as accurate. It’s more prone to erroneously identifying a picture of someone on the side of a bus as a pedestrian, as an example.”</p>\n<p>“Radar or LiDAR in combination with cameras is a superior solution from a safety perspective,” he declared.</p>\n<p>He added that the cost of LiDAR has come down dramatically. Sub-$500 LiDAR is readily available from Hesai and RoboSense, while Luminar offers LiDAR priced around $1,000.</p>\n<h3>Regulatory and Operational Challenges</h3>\n<p>Shaving component costs from its robots is not the only way Vayu’s robots can save a company money. “Passive sensors typically require less maintenance and are more durable, contributing to lower operational costs and increased reliability,” Vena said.</p>\n<p>However, there can be a downside to passive sensors. “These sensors generally offer less accuracy and detail than LiDAR systems, potentially affecting Vayu’s ability to navigate and detect obstacles effectively in certain conditions,” Vena noted.</p>\n<p>“Environmental factors such as lighting, weather [conditions], and dynamic obstacles could impair the robot’s performance, raising safety concerns,” he explained.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“Moreover,” he added, “developing robust AI algorithms to compensate for the lack of LiDAR is technically challenging and resource-intensive, necessitating significant investment in research and development to ensure reliable operation.”</p>\n<p>There are also regulatory and operational challenges facing delivery robots in general. “Many cities have rules about where such bots can operate, and sometimes they aren’t allowed on sidewalks or in bike lanes,” Abuelsamid explained, “and there are roads where a 20-mph bot might not be allowed.”</p>\n<p>“There’s also the problem of having someone available to receive deliveries,” he added. “A passenger can get out of a robotaxi and [leave]. But someone needs to be at the destination to remove packages from a bot. If the bot goes out on a delivery run and no one is there, it might have to wait or return without making the delivery.”</p>\n<h3>Opportunities Available</h3>\n<p>Despite the challenges facing delivery bots, Vena argued that Vayu’s bot can open up numerous opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Its cost advantage allows it to penetrate new markets, including small- and medium-sized enterprises that previously found robotic delivery solutions prohibitively expensive,” he said.</p>\n<p>“There are also opportunities for partnerships and collaborations with other technology companies to enhance Vayu’s capabilities and expand its applications,” he continued. In its statement, Vayu explained that its technology is form-factor agnostic, allowing it to be used in various wheeled, quadrupedal, and bipedal robots.</p>\n<p>“Any place where you use LiDAR for short- to mid-depth sensing, our technology could replace those depth sensors and sometimes provide even more robust output but with the cost of a standard camera,” Gopalan asserted.</p>\n<p>Vena warned that opportunities come with risks, such as navigating regulatory landscapes, ensuring market acceptance, and facing competition from companies using advanced sensor technologies. “To succeed,” he said, “Vayu must stay ahead of technological advancements and address potential security risks associated with cyberthreats.”</p>\n<p><em><i></i> Editor’s Note: The Vayu photo and video featured in this article are courtesy of Vayu Robotics.</em></p>\n",

      },
      "content": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has heralded the start of a technological revolution. This frenzy questions whether AI will, in the next year or two, set in motion a desktop and laptop “supercycle.”</p>\n<p>A supercycle period is marked by a significant surge in PC sales and upgrades, driven by compelling advancements in technology that persuade consumers and businesses to update their hardware at an accelerated pace.</p>\n<p>Given the flattening of overall sales since Covid-19 ended, the PC industry could sure use it.</p>\n<p>Like any transformational technology, AI’s effects on consumer and corporate markets are complex and require a comprehensive analysis.</p>\n<p>Prominent PC CEOs have shown off new notebook PCs with AI-embedded mobile processors for months. Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm are incorporating this new technology into their products this year and beyond.</p>\n<p>Many industry experts predict AI PCs will start a supercycle upgrade phenomenon in the second half of the year when more AI PCs hit the market. But is this likely?</p>\n<p>Recently, Intel and its partners showcased AI PCs equipped with on-device generative AI capabilities for enhancing photographs, movies, and presentations. These devices also feature real-time language and speech translation, effectively eliminating communication barriers.</p>\n<p>However, removing emotion from the equation, the supercycle upgrade phenomenon may be more muted than many expect despite the hype.</p>\n<h3>Consumer Market Dynamics</h3>\n<p>AI, particularly gen AI cloud-based applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, has been wildly popular among desktop and laptop users. While these apps do not require a dedicated AI processor, we expect customers to upgrade to newer computer models as AI-powered features such as voice assistants, predictive text, and image recognition enhance PC usability.</p>\n<p>Proponents claim that as AI algorithms improve, they will uncover myriad applications that require more computational power, leading people to buy more powerful PCs and laptops. There is logic in this thought process, as AI-driven gaming and immersive VR apps may increase demand for high-performance computer hardware.</p>\n<p>However, skeptics argue that AI may improve user experiences but not be an overwhelming catalyst for sales. The commoditization of basic AI functions across many devices may reduce user motivation to update. Moreover, economic uncertainty stemming from inflation and high interest rates may limit discretionary IT upgrade investments.</p>\n<h3>Corporate Customers Slow To Adopt Arm Flavors of Windows</h3>\n<p>Compatibility issues have historically kept enterprise clients from adopting the Arm version of Windows. Many enterprise processes depend on x86-optimized software and apps. Adapting these vital tools to Arm platforms requires substantial testing, rebuilding, or replacement. Such projects are resource-intensive and may disrupt workflow.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 10726:a-tnw-nl-970s-1 cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 10726:a-tnw-nl-970s-1 cc: --></div>\n<p>The seamless integration of Arm devices with enterprise infrastructure, including peripheral devices and management systems, hasn’t been as smooth as many customers would have liked over the past few years. This compatibility gap (especially at the app level) has deterred organizations from investing in Arm-based Windows solutions.</p>\n<p>A fear of performance parity and optimization on Arm architecture also contributes to enterprise hesitance. While Arm processor technology has improved, reservations remain about their ability to match x86 processors in resource-intensive activities.</p>\n<p>Businesses that depend on fast and reliable computer performance have been cautious about switching to Arm-based Windows machines. However, over the past two years, Microsoft has begun providing assurances of equivalent or greater performance levels and improved compatibility with the existing software ecosystem to reduce enterprise client hesitance to adopt Arm versions of Windows.</p>\n<p>The latest Arm Windows 11 builds reportedly have greatly improved program compatibility, performance, and battery life.</p>\n<h3>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite Stands Out</h3>\n<p>Qualcomm is banking on its new and improved mobile computing offerings, which offer best-in-class performance and efficiency that could be a tailwind for the chip manufacturer in this PC upgrade supercycle.</p>\n<p>If recent benchmark results are accurate, its new Snapdragon X Elite offering, announced a few months ago, positions the company as the clear leader in the AI-enabled silicon space against Intel, AMD, and even Apple. It’s worth noting that Apple released its latest M3 chipsets days after Qualcomm introduced its Snapdragon X Elite.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SmartTechCheck Moment Interview with Nitin Kumar 4 25 24\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGMSOGAHT4c\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>While Snapdragon X Elite chips are powerful and energy efficient, Apple’s chips, including the A-series in iPhones and iPads, are known for their perfect integration with Apple’s hardware and software environment.</p>\n<p>Apple uses this holistic approach to fine-tune its CPUs for optimal speed and power efficiency, creating a user experience that often sets industry standards. Apple’s robust ecosystem management allows for rapid adoption of new technologies and optimizations, further strengthening its competitive edge.</p>\n<p>Viewed through that prism, Qualcomm’s approach appears to imitate Apple’s integration approach, particularly at the silicon and operating system levels.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm claims its internal benchmarking outperforms Apple’s latest M3 chip solutions, a revelation that might shock ardent Apple fans, especially given that the Snapdragon X Elite apparently surpasses the M3 chips in performance and battery life.</p>\n<p>However, the differences between the macOS and Windows 11 operating systems make the analysis challenging.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Recently, Qualcomm has been permitting reporters, bloggers, and reviewers to utilize reference design laptops for benchmarks without interference. The company demonstrated a new wave of applications tailored to take advantage of the Snapdragon X Elite’s unique capabilities, especially its best-in-class NPU (neural processing unit). More significantly, Qualcomm demonstrated several PC games that ran flawlessly in emulation.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, cynics would state that AI’s influence on desktop and laptop sales depends on various factors — budgetary constraints, legacy infrastructure dependencies, and AI adoption across industries are key.</p>\n<h3>The Outlook for AI Impact on PC Sales</h3>\n<p>While no one wants to be a Debbie Downer, let’s face it: AI’s impact on desktop and laptop sales in the next year or two depends on a complex interaction of factors. It all boils down to AI’s ability to create compelling transformative user experiences, and business customers may respond differently from traditional consumers.</p>\n<p>AI-powered features might potentially boost consumer PC sales, but market saturation and economic uncertainty may limit this, primarily due to the damaging impact of inflation on discretionary spending. With the average price of gasoline in the U.S. ranging from nearly $4 per gallon to almost $6, depending on what state you live in, can the typical consumer rationalize upgrading their legacy PC?</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In contrast, corporate and enterprise digital transformation and remote work enablement may stimulate demand for AI-optimized PCs. Although Qualcomm — and, to a lesser extent, AMD and Intel — now offer competitive semiconductor ingredients to all the major PC OEMs, the issue remains whether AI-optimized applications are enough to convince users to upgrade. I’m holding my breath a bit.</p>\n<p>Undeniably, the benefits of these new AI offerings include reduced latency, longer battery life without compromising performance, and local AI-produced data management for security.</p>\n<p>Still, Windows’ fragmented message could be troublesome. Every PC OEM will tout AI’s benefits in a siloed manner, which could confuse and undercut the “you should upgrade now” argument.</p>\n<h3>The Future of AI in PCs</h3>\n<p>Ironically, Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June may boost the consumer supercycle phenomenon because the Cupertino company excels at clearly, singularly, and passionately describing compelling new usage models enabled by AI like no other.</p>\n<p>If it does indeed fully embrace AI in the new iterations of iOS, macOS, and iPadOS, as rumors indicate, there’s no better company than Apple to message the benefits of AI in a way that the majority of consumers will fully comprehend.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the vaunted supercycle is much more likely to develop at the business and corporate levels. CIOs continuously search for methods to boost productivity and efficiency and are not expected to wait for Apple to point the way. Moreover, most companies want AI applications locally (or at the edge) for security reasons, and AI-enhanced collaborative tools are enticing.</p>\n<p>Given all this, the AI-driven desktop and laptop sales supercycle may not be as dramatic as most PC OEMs hope. The good news for the PC industry is that Microsoft’s substantially more robust Arm version of Windows 11, as well as Qualcomm and others’ compelling silicon solutions, are removing many barriers to customers upgrading to AI-enabled PCs.</p>\n<p>The runway may be longer than some might like, but AI will be nothing less than revolutionary over the next several years.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>While the major generative AI service providers depend on the cloud to power their large language models, Apple will be taking a different tack with the next version of its mobile operating system, which is set to be revealed in June.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, in his weekly newsletter published Sunday, predicted that the AI features planned for iOS 18 will be performed on the iPhone and not in the cloud.</p>\n<p>“As the world awaits Apple’s big AI unveiling on June 10, it looks like the initial wave of features will work entirely on-device,” Gurman wrote in the Q&amp;A section of his Power On newsletter. “That means there’s no cloud processing component to the company’s large language model, the software that powers the new capabilities.”</p>\n<p>In February, Gurman reported that iOS 18 would be chock full of AI features. Apple is training both Siri and the iPhone’s Spotlight search tool on large language models to answer more complex questions accurately, he wrote.</p>\n<p>Other AI-powered features cited by Gurman included automatically generating playlists in Apple Music and presentation slides in Keynote, as well as more deeply integrating AI into Health, Messages, Numbers, Pages, and Shortcuts.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Privacy Approach</h3>\n<p>Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif., cited some benefits associated with running generative AI solely on a device. “It provides consumers with enhanced privacy,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Sensitive data can be processed locally without needing to be transmitted over the internet.”</p>\n<p>“The approach also offers faster response times,” he continued. “Data doesn’t have to travel to remote servers for analysis.”</p>\n<p>While on-device AI may wring some latency from the processing, Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reticleresearch.com/\">Reticle Research</a>, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City, pointed out a drawback to the approach.</p>\n<p>“Depending on the kind of query, the performance might be better,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but the advantage to cloud-based AI is that it can accommodate larger models, so it’s more capable than a lot of what’s possible on-device today.”</p>\n<p>Vena also noted that on-device AI enables offline functionality, ensuring uninterrupted service even in areas with poor or no connectivity. “With reduced dependence on internet access, consumers experience greater reliability in AI-powered features,” he said.</p>\n<p>He added that local processing contributes to improved device battery life and allows for customization and personalization tailored to individual preferences without relying on centralized data storage.</p>\n<h3>AI Could ‘Crater Older iPhones’</h3>\n<p>Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore, asserted that battery life could become a problem for Apple.</p>\n<p>“AI is very power-hungry and needs to run all the time,” he told TechNewsWorld. “On-device processing requires intimate knowledge of both the AI — so the hardware can be tuned — and hardware technology — NPUs or neural processing units — in order to allow the battery-powered device to have sufficient battery life.”</p>\n<p>“This will crater an older iPhone’s battery life and likely also result in a poor AI experience, forcing a hardware refresh,” he said.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>At this point, it’s not known which older iPhone models will be able to handle the AI features in the upcoming mobile operating system, acknowledged Tim Bajarin, president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativestrategies.com/\">Creative Strategies</a>, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif. “But most likely, the iOS 18 AI version will require newer phones with higher AI dedicated processors,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“It could drive Apple into a new refresh supercycle, as the majority of their users will want it to power AI apps as fast as possible,” he added.</p>\n<p>Anshel Sag, a senior analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/\">Moor Insights &amp; Strategy</a>, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas, agreed. “There is a chance it could drive an upgrade cycle, but I always believe that compelling AI use cases tied to AI hardware capabilities drive upgrade cycles,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>5G Supercycle Repeat?</h3>\n<p>Some features could be unlocked for more recent iPhone models with neural engines on their chips, but most likely, the biggest functionality will be attained on a new device, noted Will Kerwin, a technology equity analyst with <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/products/research\">Morningstar Research Services</a> in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“We think that if Apple gets AI products right for the iPhone, it could spur a supercycle of customer refreshes to get this new functionality,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This would be similar to what we saw with the first 5G iPhones.”</p>\n<p>“However,” Kerwin cautioned, “we have no information on what Apple’s AI plans for the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup are, and it’s too soon to tell if such a supercycle will actually occur.”</p>\n<p>Vena added that while older devices might not have the same level of hardware capabilities as newer models, Apple’s optimization efforts could still enable AI functions to some extent.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“However, the full range of AI features might not be available or perform as efficiently on older devices due to hardware limitations,” he said. “This could incentivize some users to upgrade to newer iPhone models to access the latest AI-powered features with optimal performance.”</p>\n<p>Rubin noted that historically, Apple usually allows a generation or two of previous devices to upgrade to the latest operating system, so if AI is part of the operating system, previous generations may be able to tap into most, if not all, the new capabilities. “But it wouldn’t be surprising if there were degradation in older phones and implementation of only some features,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Apple AI Partner Prospects</h3>\n<p>Bloomberg’s Gurman also predicted that Apple would probably offer some cloud-based AI features powered through partnerships with an AI provider. Reports in recent weeks have suggested that Apple is in discussions with Google, OpenAI, and China’s Baidu about potential generative AI partnerships.</p>\n<p>Morningstar’s Kerwin maintained that even with a partner, Apple can keep its AI out of the cloud. “We believe that even in partnering with another AI firm, Apple could host a smaller model version on-device and not erode its focus on privacy and security,” he said.</p>\n<p>If Apple does embrace a gen AI partner, the relationship will likely be short-lived. “It will be a gradual walk toward completely on-device once the models are optimized and quantized to a size that can quickly and efficiently run on-device,” Moor’s Sag predicted. “It’s just a matter of time, more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Enderle was skeptical of the partnering reports. “Apple doesn’t partner well, so there are likely to be a number of execution issues, including erosion of security and privacy, as well as some severe anticipated reliability and performance issues,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I expect they will eventually have to buy an AI company to make this work,” he added.</p>\n<h3>WWDC24</h3>\n<p>Apple will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) online from June 10 through 14, 2024. Developers and students will have the opportunity to attend in person at a special event at Apple Park on opening day.</p>\n",

I had my eye on that earlier model — primarily because of its 16-inch viewing field. But I held off buying the non-Plus predecessor a few months ago, hoping for something better in the Plus range.</p>\n<p>Last year, Google introduced the Chromebook Plus category to step up a line of more powerful ChromeOS laptops with AI features that were not available in the non-Plus line. Though not a Plus designation, the original Acer Chromebook 516 GE checked most of my preferred boxes but lacked the build quality and performance boost its replacement provides.</p>\n<p>I was also interested in the built-in access to Google’s Gemini AI along with Chromebook Plus perks that provide access to additional special software and services. The new 516 GE checked those boxes. The concept of using a more power-packed Chromebook for personal and work chores and a boost in gaming opportunities make this refreshed laptop an irresistible option.</p>\n<h3>Worth the Wait</h3>\n<p>This 16-inch-wide quad extended graphics array (WQXGA) model is powered by the Intel Core 5 120U processor with Intel Graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB PCIe Gen4 SSD storage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-open-view.jpg\" alt=\"Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE open view\" width=\"800\" height=\"846\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-open-view.jpg 800w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-open-view-284x300.jpg 284w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-open-view-768x812.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>(Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>The GE stands for “Gaming Edition” and is unique because it provides cloud-based gaming features with decent performance. Although it lacks a dedicated AMD or Nvidia gaming processor, the tweaked circuitry enhances the fast delivery of games with no lag time on cloud-based gaming servers.</p>\n<p>The wait was worth it for this upgraded Chromebook laptop. I bought this unit to supplement my work environment with a more flexible and capable ChromeOS-driven laptop with a larger screen. Chromebooks rarely come with screens larger than 14 inches, so I was immediately drawn to the new release.</p>\n<p>For $649, the Chromebook Plus 516 GE is a solid performer, giving me an impressive upgrade over my other computers, both Linux and Chromebook varieties. The larger laptop screen, Chromebook Plus moniker, and enhanced performance are tough to find in other Chromebook devices at any price compared to this new unit.</p>\n<h3>Unbeatable Configuration Pluses</h3>\n<p>The combination of Acer hardware ideally balances price with performance options. Its superior image quality and high pixel density provide a high-end benefit. The 516 GE is fast and comfortable, two critically important traits considering the number of hours I spend on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>The Acer 516 GE Chromebook Plus is powered by a newer Intel Core 5 120U processor, listed as two times faster than the Intel Core i5-1240P in the prior model. If you are unfamiliar with Chromebooks, do not be put off by the installed 8GB of memory. The ChromeOS — a souped-up Chrome browser with built-in tools to let it function as an operating system, is not hampered in its performance due to any RAM strain.</p>\n<h3>Impressive Audio Quality</h3>\n<p>I cannot rave enough about the huge audio improvement packed into this device. Four upward-firing speakers, with two each vertically positioned on both sides of the keyboard, bring the best-sounding audio I have heard from my other Chromebooks. The credit goes to DTS Audio and Smart Amplifier technology.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>These speakers provide distortion-free sound. The audio components eliminate unwanted sound vibrations using force-canceling woofers fired in opposite directions in perfect unison. You will not find Dolby Atmos in the configuration, but I do not miss it. These stereo speakers provide loud, solid volume and excellent sound quality.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Display Features</h3>\n<p>The 16-inch IPS 16:10 QHD 120Hz screen hits 350 nits of brightness with a 2560 x 1600 screen resolution. WQXGA technology is used in high-end monitors and screens and delivers higher pixel density with sharper images compared to lower resolutions of 2560 x 1600 pixels.</p>\n<p>This panel provides more screen space, detail, and a better visual experience. It’s also faster, with a 120Hz refresh rate that doubles the 60Hz standard on every other Chromebook.</p>\n<p>However, this is not a touch screen. That, for me, is just a minor compromise. However, more dedicated gamers looking to play Android games on this Chromebook might be dissatisfied with not having touchscreen access.</p>\n<p>Since this laptop is not a two-in-one design, reaching across the clamshell just to touch input on the screen is not part of my usual computing routine. At least for my usage, if the keyboard does not detach from the panel or fold under it, I have little need for a touch screen.</p>\n<h3>Superior Build Quality</h3>\n<p>Chassis quality, keyboard dexterity, and touchpad travel are factors in lesser-quality Chromebooks that cheapen their appeal. The Acer 516 GE avoids all three, giving it a substantial physical upgrade.</p>\n<p>Weighing 3.7 pounds, the new model looks classy in two-tone black. My only disappointment with the outer appearance is the smudge-fest on the smooth, glossy, obsidian black metal fame. Fingertip remnants do not easily disappear.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-smudgy-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE fingerprint smudges\" width=\"800\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-smudgy-cover.jpg 800w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-smudgy-cover-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-smudgy-cover-768x505.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>(Photo by Author)</p>\n<p>The aluminum frame has no play. It feels rigid and steady in the hand and to the fingers. The RBG backlit keyboard design is also a solid selling point for gamers and office workers. Numerous color options and brightness levels are available.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-2up.jpg\" alt=\"Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE backlit keyboard\" width=\"800\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-2up.jpg 800w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-2up-300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-GE-2up-768x566.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>(Image courtesy of Acer)</p>\n<p>This laptop has one HDMI 2.1 display connector. I would prefer two, as a second HDMI port would be useful for attaching more accessories. It has two USB Type-C (supporting DisplayPort and USB charging) ports, one USB Type-A port, an Ethernet RJ-45 port, and a 3.5mm headphone/speaker jack.</p>\n<p>The 10-hour power from the 65-watt-hour Lithium-Ion battery is not an exaggeration. I tested the fully charged battery, which lasted within 20 minutes of the stated 10-hour capacity before running out of juice.</p>\n<p>I was pleased with the front-facing, full HD camera (1920 x 1080) with 1080p video at 60 FPS compared to typical Chromebook low-quality webcams. Its image quality, however, is not as good as the third-party mountable webcams I usually use as Chromebook video cam replacements. The temporal noise reduction and blue glass lens features produce acceptable, but not premium, results.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>The Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE could be one of the best Chromebook Plus options. It serves a dual purpose as a very capable cloud-based gaming computer and a feature-rich general-purpose laptop for business and personal use. Combine it with a big external monitor and mouse to create a functional desktop computer alternative.</p>\n<p>This model exceeded my expectations for ease of use and performance. Acer added key features beyond what was available in the earlier model to put the Chromebook Plus unit in a class of its own.</p>\n<p>Be careful if you decide to buy this unit. Its earlier non-Plus version is still on sale at an attractive reduced price. Ensure you are getting the upgraded model by checking these three details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The model number is CBG516-2H-59S4</li>\n<li>The build date is 2024</li>\n<li>Chromebook Plus branding on the cover&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Acer plans to offer at least a second version of this Chromebook Plus 516 GE configured with 16GB of RAM, larger storage capacity, and a choice of colors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><i></i> Suggest a Review</h3>\n<p>Is there a tech product or application you’d like to suggest for review?

      "content": "<p>Ten technologies that need to be on every company’s radar were identified Tuesday in a trends report released by global technology research company Forrester.</p>\n<p>The 30-page report identified four technologies expected to deliver benefits in the short term to companies, four predicted to deliver benefits in the medium term, and two that will deliver benefits in the long term.</p>\n<p>The report explained each trend’s benefits, potential business value, important use cases, examples of where it’s being used, and its risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Short-term technologies include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generative AI for visual content;</li>\n<li>Gen AI for language;</li>\n<li>IoT security; and</li>\n<li>TuringBots, a use of AI for software development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mid-term tech includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI agents;</li>\n<li>Autonomous mobility;</li>\n<li>Edge Intelligence; and</li>\n<li>Quantum security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Long-term tech includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended Reality (XR); and</li>\n<li>Zero Trust Edge (ZTE), a security and networking solution that can be delivered by a single vendor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Creativity Accelerant</h3>\n<p>According to Forrester, gen AI for visual content will offer the most potential for marketers and other creatives. The technology will accelerate creativity, with global enterprises that manage a portfolio of brands seeing the most significant benefits.</p>\n<p>Those benefits won’t be without risks, it added, such as distorted features in visual output, unintended likenesses of public figures, inaccurate images, and legal liability from copyright infringement of training data or visual output.</p>\n<p>Aaron J. Rafferty, founder of Tech Buzz, a media and news platform in San Jose, Calif., and <a href=\"https://www.standarddao.finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StandardDAO</a>, a community of digital asset holders in Mountain View, Calif., explained the kind of benefits gen AI for visual content can bring to the table.</p>\n<p>“What was once a 10 step process will be done in one,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“Simply create a long-form piece of video content, and it is automatically clipped into the top and most viral short-form videos, redone by AI personas that are most applicable to consumer types/ethnicities/genders, republished in multiple languages, and even reproduced for viral text via newsletters, threads, or short-form social media posts across all channels,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The best creators will shrink their teams and solely focus on improving their content,” he continued. “Their distribution channels will multiply overnight.”</p>\n<h3>Customer Service Boon</h3>\n<p>Forrester was also optimistic about gen AI for language, which it predicts will transform knowledge work. One of the areas where it will have an immediate impact is customer service — where its ability to extract and retrieve knowledge from unstructured data allows high volumes of inquiries to be handled without the cost of adding staff.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to service industries,” Rafferty said, “we are already seeing customer service being disrupted. Klarna has massively reduced [its] headcount and tens of millions in expenses. It’s as easy as building a chatbot or call agent that knows everything about your company and gets better over time as it handles customer issues and requests in real time.”</p>\n<p>While gen AI is providing immediate benefits in limited use cases, Forrester noted, it acknowledged that trust in the technology is low. “There is a black box nature to some of these large language models. Visibility can be elusive,” noted Zeid Khater, a customer data and analytics analyst at Forrester and one of the 20 contributors to the report.</p>\n<p>“Trust is growing, and it will continue to grow as we familiarize ourselves with what the technology does,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Like most technologies, there are great things that it can enable, but there are also limitations. Being aware of the limitations and what they are will help determine where the trust factor should lie.”</p>\n<p>“But for sensitive decision-making, I don’t think there’ll be a point where AI is the be-all and end-all until we develop explainability frameworks that are, to themselves, reliable to a high degree,” he added.</p>\n<h3>IoT Security Growing in Importance</h3>\n<p>The report noted that IoT security is an important trend because it’s evolving to protect critical data and devices. It explained that IoT security technologies reduce the chances of compromising critical data and can accelerate the value of edge intelligence technology. Traditional endpoint security and attack surface management solutions are not equipped to protect these devices.</p>\n<p>“IoT security is crucial as these devices are now deeply embedded in critical infrastructure and everyday operations,” said Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP of product strategy at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zimperium.com\">Zimperium</a>, a mobile security company based in Dallas.</p>\n<p>“With the increase in connectivity, each IoT device, including mobile devices, can be a potential entry point for cyberthreats,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Ensuring robust security measures for both IoT and mobile devices is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of networks.”</p>\n<p>John Gallagher, vice president of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.viakoo.com/\">Viakoo</a> Labs, an enterprise IoT security company in Mountain View, Calif., explained that IoT represents a rapidly growing attack surface.</p>\n<p>“Securing vulnerable IoT devices is critically important for enterprises,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Breached IoT devices are having devastating impacts, such as ransomware, data loss, changing the chemical balance in a municipal water supply, replacing real camera footage with deepfakes or disrupting transportation systems.”</p>\n<p>“Like everything in security, a particular segment does not take off until the threats arise,” added Richard Stiennon, founder and chief research analyst of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://it-harvest.com/\">IT-Harvest</a>, a cybersecurity industry analyst firm in Birmingham, Mich.</p>\n<p>“In the case of IoT, the recent revelations that China has persistently been infiltrating critical control systems for years has boosted IoT security,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“The number of connected devices grows every day,” he continued. “It should not come as a surprise that attacks against those devices are on the rise.</p>\n<h3>Uprooting the Cryptographic Landscape</h3>\n<p>Forrester predicted in its report that quantum security — which uses quantum mechanics principles and quantum-resistant algorithms to perform cryptographic tasks or secure communications — will uproot the current encryption and identity-and-access-management landscape.</p>\n<p>“Uproot is too strong a word,” argued Stiennon. “Quantum computing is still years away. We are about at the stage of the first transistor — 1947 — relative to the first computer using semiconductors.”</p>\n<p>“That said,” he continued, “it makes perfect sense for organizations to get their encryption keys in order. While they are doing that, they can catalog all the places they will need to switch to quantum-safe encryption and create a long-term plan to re-key and transition.”</p>\n<p>Forrester’s prediction, though, seemed accurate to Duncan Jones, head of cybersecurity at <a href=\"https://www.quantinuum.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quantinuum</a>, an international quantum computing hardware and software company. “Quantum computing will completely upend cybersecurity,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Every inch of cyberspace will be impacted.”</p>\n<p>“But it’s not all bad news,” he added. “Although future quantum computers will break many encryption systems, we can also harness quantum technology today to strengthen systems. Examples of this include hardening keys with quantum randomness. In the long term, we will view quantum as a gift for cybersecurity rather than a threat.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>While large language AI models continue to make headlines, small language models are where the action is. At least, that’s what Meta appears to be betting on, according to a paper recently released by a team of its research scientists.</p>\n<p>Large language models, like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, can use billions, even trillions, of parameters to obtain their results. The size of those models makes them too big to run on mobile devices. So, the Meta scientists noted in their research, there is a growing need for efficient large language models on mobile devices — a need driven by increasing cloud costs and latency concerns.</p>\n<p>In their research, the scientists explained how they created high-quality large language models with fewer than a billion parameters, which they maintained is a good size for mobile deployment.</p>\n<p>Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, the scientists achieved results with their small language model comparable in some areas to Meta’s Llama LLM.</p>\n<p>“There’s a prevailing paradigm that ‘bigger is better,’ but this is showing it’s really about how parameters are used,” said Nick DeGiacomo, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.bucephalus.tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bucephalus</a>, an AI-powered e-commerce supply chain platform based in New York City.</p>\n<p>“This paves the way for more widespread adoption of on-device AI,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>A Crucial Step</h3>\n<p>Meta’s research is significant because it challenges the current norm of cloud-reliant AI, which often sees data being crunched in far-off data centers, explained Darian Shimy, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://www.futurefund.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FutureFund</a>, a venture capital firm in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“By bringing AI processing into the device itself, Meta is flipping the script — potentially reducing the carbon footprint associated with data transmission and processing in massive, energy-consuming data centers and making device-based AI a key player in the tech ecosystem,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“This research is the first comprehensive and publicly shared effort of this magnitude,” added Yashin Manraj, CEO of <a href=\"https://pvotal.tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pvotal Technologies</a>, an end-to-end security software developer, in Eagle Point, Ore.</p>\n<p>“It is a crucial first step in achieving an SLM-LLM harmonized approach where developers can find the right balance between cloud and on-device data processing,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It lays the groundwork where the promises of AI-powered applications can reach the level of support, automation, and assistance that have been marketed in recent years but lacked the engineering capacity to support those visions.”</p>\n<p>Meta scientists have also taken a significant step in downsizing a language model. “They are proposing a model shrink by order of magnitude, making it more accessible for wearables, hearables, and mobile phones,” said Nishant Neekhra, senior director of mobile marketing at <a href=\"https://www.skyworksinc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skyworks Solutions</a>, a semiconductor company in Irvine, Calif.</p>\n<p>“They’re presenting a whole new set of applications for AI while providing new ways for AI to interact in the real world,” he told TechNewsWorld. “By shrinking, they are also solving a major growth challenge plaguing LLMs, which is their ability to be deployed on edge devices.”</p>\n<h3>High Impact on Health Care</h3>\n<p>One area where small language models could have a meaningful impact is in medicine.</p>\n<p>“The research promises to unlock the potential of generative AI for applications involving mobile devices, which are ubiquitous in today’s health care landscape for remote monitoring and biometric assessments,” Danielle Kelvas, a physician advisor with <a href=\"https://www.itmedical.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IT Medical</a>, a global medical software development company, told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>By demonstrating that effective SLMs can have fewer than a billion parameters and still perform comparably to larger models in certain tasks, she continued, the researchers are opening the door for widespread adoption of AI in everyday health monitoring and personalized patient care.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Kelvas explained that using SLMs can also ensure that sensitive health data can be processed securely on a device, enhancing patient privacy. They can also facilitate real-time health monitoring and intervention, which is critical for patients with chronic conditions or those requiring continuous care.</p>\n<p>She added that the models could also reduce the technological and financial barriers to deploying AI in healthcare settings, potentially democratizing advanced health monitoring technologies for broader populations.</p>\n<h3>Reflecting Industry Trends</h3>\n<p>Meta’s focus on small AI models for mobile devices reflects a broader industry trend towards optimizing AI for efficiency and accessibility, explained <a href=\"https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/members/carimu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caridad Muñoz</a>, a professor of new media technology at CUNY LaGuardia Community College. “This shift not only addresses practical challenges but also aligns with growing concerns about the environmental impact of large-scale AI operations,” she told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“By championing smaller, more efficient models, Meta is setting a precedent for sustainable and inclusive AI development,” Muñoz added.</p>\n<p>Small language models also fit into the edge computing trend, which is focusing on bringing AI capabilities closer to users. “The large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others are often overkill — ‘when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,’” DeGiacomo said.</p>\n<p>“Specialized, tuned models can be more efficient and cost-effective for specific tasks,” he noted. “Many mobile applications don’t require cutting-edge AI. You don’t need a supercomputer to send a text message.”</p>\n<p>“This approach allows the device to focus on handling the routing between what can be answered using the SLM and specialized use cases, similar to the relationship between generalist and specialist doctors,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Profound Effect on Global Connectivity</h3>\n<p>Shimy maintained the implications SLMs could have on global connectivity are profound.</p>\n<p>“As on-device AI becomes more capable, the necessity for continuous internet connectivity diminishes, which could dramatically shift the tech landscape in regions where internet access is inconsistent or costly,” he observed. “This could democratize access to advanced technologies, making cutting-edge AI tools available across diverse global markets.”</p>\n<p>While Meta is leading the development of SLMs, Manraj noted that developing countries are aggressively monitoring the situation to keep their AI development costs in check. “China, Russia, and Iran seem to have developed a high interest in the ability to defer compute calculations on local devices, especially when cutting-edge AI hardware chips are embargoed or not easily accessible,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We do not expect this to be an overnight or drastic change though,” he predicted, “because complex, multi-language queries will still require cloud-based LLMs to provide cutting-edge value to end users. However, this shift towards allowing an on-device ‘last mile’ model can help reduce the burden of the LLMs to handle smaller tasks, reduce feedback loops, and provide local data enrichment.”</p>\n<p>“Ultimately,” he continued, “the end user will be clearly the winner, as this would allow a new generation of capabilities on their devices and a more promising overhaul of front-end applications and how people interact with the world.”</p>\n<p>“While the usual suspects are driving innovation in this sector with a promising potential impact on everyone’s daily lives,” he added, “SLMs could also be a Trojan Horse that provides a new level of sophistication in the intrusion of our daily lives by having models capable of harvesting data and metadata at an unprecedented level. We hope that with the proper safeguards, we are able to channel these efforts to a productive outcome.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>At <a href=\"https://www.embedded-world.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Embedded World</a> last week, Qualcomm made a major IoT announcement about a new AI-ready platform for both home and industrial use. There was also an additional briefing on Qualcomm Connect regarding service-defined Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>These announcements signal a significant effort to fix the train wrecks that smart homes and smart buildings have been.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss that this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week: a new AI-ready desktop computer from Lenovo based on the latest AMD Ryzen 8000 platform. There are a lot of AI-ready things coming.</p>\n<h3>Challenges With Smart Home Technology</h3>\n<p>I’ve been following smart home technology since the 1970s when I first got excited about X10 and proceeded to rip out all of the light switches in my small apartment and replace them with X10 alternatives.</p>\n<p>I also had an X10 robotic turntable back then, which was pretty cool when it worked. You could select individual tracks and replay a stack of records. However, it worked far less than it should have, and X10 technology was dubious at best on a good day.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve tried multiple platforms from various vendors that didn’t <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-smart-home-jury-is-still-out-on-matter-ai-could-help-178442.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interoperate</a>, often resulting in more aggravation and cost than benefit. Recently, I had a company come out and bid on replacing my Insteon system with something newer. That bid was a whopping $45,000, which would blow out my modest budget. I decided not to buy that expensive solution because it, too, was likely to become obsolete in a few years.</p>\n<p>We are now moving to AI, and there has been progress on standards. The <a href=\"https://developers.home.google.com/matter/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Matter</a> standard has gotten a substantial amount of interest. In addition, the Amazon Alexa platform has been surprisingly good at embracing third-party platforms and allowing voice control over the products it will connect to. However, patches or updates on any of the connected systems often result in them not working for a while or at all.</p>\n<p>What is needed is a higher degree of hardware commonality to reduce the complexity that is making what should be easy-to-use hardware hard enough that most haven’t adopted the technology.</p>\n<h3>Qualcomm Connect: Service Defined Wi-Fi</h3>\n<p>Working in concert with British Telecom, Comcast, and a few other large cable companies and carriers, Qualcomm has created a solution called <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/12/the-promise-of-qualcomm-service-defined-wi-fi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Service Defined Wi-Fi</a> that allows these internet service providers to offer a service that will embrace your compliant smart home devices and integrate them into a common central control that users can access at home or away from home.</p>\n<p>You’d log into a user portal to see and control your smart home switches, plugs, appliances, security cameras, TVs, lighting, HVAC system, and other connected devices — like your electric car, for instance — and access and control those devices from any connected PC or smartphone while at home or when you are remote.</p>\n<p>The handy thing about a service provider approach is that not only can you call for support, but these providers regularly provide technicians who, for a fee, can troubleshoot your problems remotely or on-premises and get you up and running, giving users a better experience than the DIY approach that most solutions require today.</p>\n<p>But this addresses only part of the problem.</p>\n<h3>Qualcomm’s AI-Ready IoT Platform</h3>\n<p>Last week, Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/04/qualcomm-announces-breakthrough-wi-fi-technology-and-introduces-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> new embedded edge AI platforms and micro-power Wi-Fi SoCs, potentially creating a level of standardization in these edge devices that should provide a far more consistent experience when coupled with a Service Defined Wi-Fi offering.</p>\n<p>Along with 35 companies at Embedded World, Qualcomm is bringing to market a cross-vendor solution with standardized hardware that should reduce the cost of creating and servicing next-generation IoT smart building solutions for homes or businesses far more easily than it has been.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The announced hardware uses up to 88% less power than previous generations and uses the most advanced wireless technologies currently available, like the Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/wi-fi/qcc730\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QCC730</a> platform for Wi-Fi IoT connectivity. These features enable the use of more battery-powered IoT devices and fewer that require AC power, resulting in significantly lower installation and service costs.</p>\n<p>These modules could enable better security camera solutions and reduce your concerns about porch pirates, pet pirates, and that new raft of thieves flying in from other countries to burgle your home. The result should be a more comprehensive system to manage your home both when you are there and especially when you are not.</p>\n<h3>AI for Smarter Home Management</h3>\n<p>Ideally, when we have Service Defined Wi-Fi, Google Matter, and Qualcomm’s AI-ready platform, we’ll be able to overlay either a cloud-based or on-premises AI solution to manage your home or business automatically.</p>\n<p>Components will work automatically by triggering both the camera and lights if someone enters your property, home, or business. They will also activate your lights and provide automated voice guidance in the case of a natural disaster, burglary, or fire, helping you and your family get out of danger as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>The system features a single interface for the entire site, offering a comprehensive AI-driven solution that proactively manages safety and security. It automatically closes electric shutters before severe weather hits and alerts you if a pet is about to escape the yard, helping to prevent potential hassles and lengthy searches (this happened to us once, and it was a multi-month pain in the butt).</p>\n<p>The ability to protect better against package theft, burglary, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/officer-warns-teens-can-get-shot-participate-tiktok-trend-causing-distress-residents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kids with too little sense and too much time</a>, pet theft or escape, and intrusions by wild animals that could put your home or pets at risk, is at the heart of the smart home concept.</p>\n<p>AI is the icing on this IoT cake, and these Qualcomm services and products are on the critical path to finally making this all work.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Smart homes and buildings have been a big disappointment that promised a lot but delivered little in the way of an easy-to-use, integrated offering. <a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>Working with a cable or telephony service provider that adopts the Qualcomm concept of Service Defined Wi-Fi and pushes IoT devices to utilize Qualcomm’s common hardware solutions should enhance the potential of smart homes. The advancements and success of Google Matter further amplify this potential.</p>\n<p>Incorporating a new class of increasingly capable AI solutions can provide autonomous control and better assure the outcomes originally promised by smart homes back in the 1970s. I guess it just took a while to figure out what was needed to fulfill the promise.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The Lenovo ThinkCentre M75 Family of Desktops</h3>\n<p>Lately, there has been a lot of focus on the AI PC, but it has all been about laptop computers, leaving those of us who live on desktop computers SOL. That changed last week with the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240416990902/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a> of Lenovo’s latest ThinkCentre desktop PCs, which use the AMD Ryzen PRO 8000 series desktop processors.</p>\n<p>The ThinkCentre M75 Gen 5 family of compact PCs is the first desktop line with NPUs (neural processing units).

      "content": "<p>I was at Intel Vision last week. Intel’s recent effort continues to remind me of Intel back in the Andy Grove days, with one exception that I think is the source of the firm’s current difficulties. What Intel needs is a Dennis Carter and an adequate marketing budget for AI, the biggest tech wave ever to hit the segment. Unfortunately, neither is in evidence.</p>\n<p>In addition, I’ve been concerned that Michael Dell retired in place, causing a lot of execution issues at Dell and causing it to lag behind its peers. Well, this is the second event where Michael Dell himself powerfully highlighted Dell (the last was at Nvidia’s event and seemed almost accidental). But this time, they hit it out of the park. It was nicely planned and well executed, suggesting Michael Dell is back. Now, Dell again has one of the most successful CEOs in history backing its plays.</p>\n<p>However, there are troubles ahead for Intel and the industry in general that I don’t think folks are taking seriously. I’ll cover those as well this week.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’ll close with my Product of the Week, the coolest laptop I saw at Intel Vision: the new Dell XPS 13 with the latest Intel Core Ultra processor.</p>\n<h3>Intel’s Strategic Execution and Leadership in US Tech</h3>\n<p>Intel is executing at a level that reminds me of Andy Grove’s days at the company, with one exception: It doesn’t have a Dennis Carter. I could argue it doesn’t have a Justin Ratner, either, but he came much later.</p>\n<p>However, in terms of trimming down the company to fight and execute on hardware, Intel is executing as quickly and as well as it did back when I worked there in the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Intel made tough decisions critical for growth and survival, like licensing x86 to AMD. Today, Intel is working to build out fabs and foundries to assure its future and the future of the tech industry in the U.S. and worldwide should there be a war between China and Taiwan. More than any other company I work with, Intel is doing the most to assure U.S. technology leadership.</p>\n<p>Intel’s Core Ultra processors are the first to market in the PC space for the broad market. Microsoft’s Surface Studio was the first, and while impressive, it is more of a developer’s bridge product and doesn’t have the reach the Intel OEMs do.</p>\n<p>As a long-term investment in the future of U.S. technology, Intel is suffering because it isn’t receiving the credit it deserves. That’s a marketing problem, yet while the company is massively funding its strategic initiatives, it’s simultaneously underfunding its image and brand marketing.</p>\n<p>Intel is not the only one. Microsoft is also underfunding marketing, and this trend seems to run across the segment, leaving everyone open to some of the very disruptive problems I’ll discuss below.</p>\n<h3>Michael Dell Is Back!</h3>\n<p>I’ve been very worried about Dell Technologies lately as it seemed to be covering up problems rather than addressing them. This concern became particularly obvious when I saw Dell’s initial AI efforts, which appeared to be more smoke than substance.</p>\n<p>It seemed as though CEO Michael Dell had retired in place, potentially leading to the same kind of problem I experienced at IBM under John Akers, who was the only IBM CEO ever fired (he didn’t retire in place, but he became operationally isolated, creating a similar leadership gap). I felt Michael Dell either needed to step up or out, and, as you might imagine, Dell did not receive that well.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>However, I saw the old Michael Dell at Intel Vision, and he is clearly stepping up now. I’m pleased that my old friend is back in the game because the last time we had a wave the size of AI hit the industry, a lot of large technology companies were either crippled or died. However, founders are incredibly powerful in their ability to pivot a company to new opportunities and against looming threats.</p>\n<p>Michael Dell is back, which bodes well for Dell’s future in what may be the riskiest time in history for every tech company. While many folks are comparing the AI wave to the Windows 95 launch, it is much bigger and more dangerous. We’ll see if Michael Dell has another “go big or go home” moment left in him. Based on what I saw at Intel Vision, he might have the necessary edge.</p>\n<h3>3 AI-related Problems Facing the Tech Industry</h3>\n<p>I’ll always be grateful to three companies that stepped in when I first started: Intel, Dell, and Microsoft. I’m also ex-IBM, and once IBM Blue, you will always be a little IBM Blue. But my loyalty to these firms means I tend to focus on what I think they should know, not merely what they want to hear — and that has landed me in a lot of trouble over the years.</p>\n<p>For instance, constantly telling Steve Ballmer that if he didn’t correct his trajectory, he would get fired put me on the wrong side of his famous temper.</p>\n<p>While it is problematic when an analyst is wrong, it can be a ton worse when we are correct, and a negative outcome we’ve warned about happens because we aren’t listened to. I learned that you could make a living externally telling folks what they need to hear, but internally, that’ll get you fired. While that shouldn’t be the case, sadly, it is.</p>\n<p>Despite the resistance to such warnings, there are pressing issues that the industry cannot afford to ignore as it ventures further into the era of artificial intelligence. Each stems from a fundamental misunderstanding or misapplication of AI technologies. These issues not only reflect missed opportunities but also pose significant risks to the stability and future of the tech sector:</p>\n<h4>Problem 1: Both smartphones and PCs are based on pre-AI concepts, and initial efforts consist of companies grafting AI onto existing platforms.</h4>\n<p>The first automobiles were called horseless carriages because they were. The auto industry started with folks who built the frame and engines and others who built the bodies, which is remarkably similar to how we build PCs today. But eventually, cars and everything else became monolithic and purposely built from the ground up. That’s how most things are built today, including smartphones.</p>\n<p>With the legendary designer from Apple, Jony Ive, and the current head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apples-jony-ive-and-openais-sam-altman-team-up-for-ai-device-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teaming</a> on an AI-powered personal device, there is a real risk that the entire WinTel thing could collapse and take Apple with it. This poses an existential threat to both the PC and smartphone industries.</p>\n<h4>Problem 2: Marketing is underfunded across the tech industry.</h4>\n<p>While we are comparing the AI PC to Windows 95, AI is potentially far bigger. We weren’t worried about Windows 95 taking massive numbers of jobs, for instance, or becoming Skynet and moving far faster than the fictional Skynet did. Windows 95 had a $400 million ($800 million adjusted for inflation) marketing budget, but it was underfunded in terms of support. There is no sign of a similar effort here.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>You may recall that one of the reasons the Windows 95 launch momentum died was that Microsoft cut the marketing budget rather than better funding support, which led to massive problems with that launch. The same thing is highly likely to happen here because it doesn’t appear that a critical mass of folks learned from those mistakes as they manage this launch, so there’s a high probability of the launch going badly.</p>\n<h4>Problem 3: People are doing insane things with AI.</h4>\n<p>Has anyone seen “The Terminator?” That movie wasn’t intended to be a to-do list for how to build an AI. I like living, thank you very much, but people are creating <a href=\"https://throwflame.com/products/thermonator-robodog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">robotic dogs with flame throwers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/sci/rogue-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hostile AIs</a> just for the heck of it.</p>\n<p>I found this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_bz1bFk7po\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scene cut</a> from “Terminator 2” that is worth watching. It could be an ad for what some idiots are doing today. I don’t think this will end well for us any more than it did for the folks in that movie. Maybe watching “Terminator 2” should be required for anyone working on these projects.</p>\n<p>Seriously, one of the stories we were sharing over lunch at Intel Vision was of a guy who, in 2008, gave an eight-year-old an Uzi submachine gun to shoot, but the child ended up <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna27399337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shooting himself</a>. Let’s not make that same mistake at scale, please.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a> Intel is improving significantly, and it reminds me of Andy Grove Intel, which helped found the PC industry. Michael Dell is back, and it’s a good thing he is because the AI wave will result in the failure of many companies across a variety of industries, much like the PC and client-server wave did in the 1990s.</p>\n<p>However, there are significant problems with how this technology is coming to market and the lack of restrictions over what folks are doing with it. Creating Skynet to see what will happen is a bad thing. I’d prefer it if researchers just watched “Terminator 2” rather than recreating it in real life. I’m just saying.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>The New Dell XPS 13 With Intel Ultra</h3>\n<p>I’ve been covering PCs since there were PCs. It’s been about two years since I found a PC I lusted after, which was the HP Folio.</p>\n<p>At Intel Vision, I saw a lust-worthy laptop: the new <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/13-new/spd/xps-13-9340-laptop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell XPS 13</a>, which is amazing-looking and high-performing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Dell-XPS-13-laptop.jpg\" alt=\"Dell XPS 13 laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Dell-XPS-13-laptop.jpg 1000w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Dell-XPS-13-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Dell-XPS-13-laptop-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>The Dell XPS 13 laptop (Credit: Dell)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It uses the new Intel Ultra AI-ready processor and is sleek and attractive. While it isn’t as light as my HP Folio, nor is it covered in leather like the Folio, it is beautiful.</p>\n<p>What really struck me was how Dell managed the function keys, which change personalities at the touch of a button. It gives the laptop a huge “wow” factor; I’m a big believer in using a PC you are proud of and want to show off because I know folks will take better care of it.</p>\n<p>The Dell XPS 13 has decent battery life and is reasonably priced for a halo product (halo products are designed to create interest in the brand and are typically priced higher to be more exclusive). It’s one of a growing number of laptops with the forward-looking Intel Ultra AI-ready processor.</p>\n<p>If you want a PC that is more future-proof than most currently on the market, one you can be proud of and that won’t break the bank, consider the new Dell XPS 13, which is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Data backups have become a must-hit target for ransomware actors, according to a report released by a cybersecurity company.</p>\n<p>The research, sponsored by Sophos and based on a survey of nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals across 14 countries, found that 94% of organizations hit by ransomware in the past year said that the threat actors attempted to compromise their backups during the attack.</p>\n<p>For organizations in the government, media, leisure and entertainment sectors, the numbers were even higher: 99%.</p>\n<p>The report explained that there are two main ways to recover encrypted data in a ransomware attack: restoring from backups and paying the ransom.</p>\n<p>“Compromising an organization’s backups enables ransomware actors to restrict their victim’s ability to recover encrypted data and, in doing so, dials up the pressure to pay,” the researchers wrote.</p>\n<p>“It’s become a common part of the script these guys go through in their attacks,” said Curtis Fechner, the threat cyber leader at <a href=\"https://www.optiv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optiv</a>, a cybersecurity solutions provider headquartered in Denver.</p>\n<p>“They always try to find where the backups are and make them inaccessible,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Part of their calculus for getting paid is finding the backups because they want to maximize the amount of revenue they can get from an attack.”</p>\n<p>“If I’ve taken your backups offline and as a means to recover, I’ve made you more likely to pay, but I can also squeeze you more because I know you’re desperate. I know you’re in a bind,” Fechner added.</p>\n<h3>Evolving Menace</h3>\n<p>When enterprise ransomware began about 10 years ago, it wasn’t too sophisticated, explained Ilia Sotnikov, a security strategist and the vice president of user experience at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.netwrix.com/\">Netwrix</a>, an IT security software company headquartered in Frisco, Texas.</p>\n<p>“The ransomware malware exploited insecure configurations or system vulnerabilities to propagate rapidly across the environment and encrypted all the data this malware managed to access. As a result, the victim was extorted to pay the ransom for a decryption key to restore their operations,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“The cybersecurity industry responded to this threat with a multi-layered security approach based on better protection and detection capabilities, as well as established backup and recovery discipline,” he said. “As a result, organizations deflected most of the attacks, minimized the number of successful ones, and learned how to effectively recover systems and operations without paying a ransom.”</p>\n<p>In turn, he continued, the ransomware strategy evolved to increase the chance of success by looking for new ways to counter the security measures. Malware became more evasive. The criminals started to spend more time in the reconnaissance stage to identify and target the most sensitive data. Gangs like Maze and LockBit started to exfiltrate the company data and added the threat of a public data leak on top of the encryption — a scheme known as double extortion.</p>\n<p>“Since then,” he added, “ransomware attackers have also started to target the backups to make recovery impossible or excessively costly, forcing the victims to pay the ransom.”</p>\n<h3>Backups Down, Ransom Up</h3>\n<p>Sophos reported that victims whose backups were compromised received ransom demands that were, on average, more than double that of those whose backups weren’t impacted. Median ransom demands for victims with compromised backups were US$2.3 million, compared to $1 million for victims with uncompromised backups.</p>\n<p>“Backups provide a safety net for organizations. However, if that backup is compromised and the organization suffers a cyberattack, it may be more desperate to recover access to their networks and data,” said Darren Guccione, CEO of <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/\">Keeper Security</a>, a password management and online storage company in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“Attackers realize that by removing access to a backup, organizations are left more vulnerable and with few options except to meet exorbitant ransom demands to get their data back,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>That inability of organizations with compromised backups to negotiate with ransomware actors was supported by the Sophos research. It found that those with compromised backups paid an average of 98% of the ransom demanded, compared to 82% without compromised backups.</p>\n<p>The report also noted that organizations whose backups were compromised were almost twice as likely to pay the ransom to recover encrypted data (67%) than those whose backups were not impacted (36%).</p>\n<h3>Higher Price of Recovery</h3>\n<p>Not only do victims with compromised backups pay higher ransoms, but they also pay more to recover from an attack.</p>\n<p>The median overall ransomware recovery costs for organizations whose backups were compromised came in eight times higher ($3 million) than those whose backups were not impacted ($375,000).</p>\n<p>Guccione explained that recovery costs for organizations that fall victim to ransomware attacks include loss of revenue due to operational disruption and damage to brand reputation, immediate and long-term recovery efforts, the cost of the ransom payment itself, as well as the possibility of fines and other potential legal liabilities.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“When the ransomware attack also includes backups, the restoration process is significantly prolonged, as organizations must rebuild their systems, data, and other critical configurations,” he said. “If the breach includes a loss of sensitive data, particularly if it involves Personal Identifiable Information, or falls under data protection regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, organizations can incur additional legal and regulatory expenses.”</p>\n<p>According to the Sophos report, recovery times from ransomware attacks are also longer for organizations with compromised backups. Only 26% of those with compromised backups recovered within a week of an attack, compared to 46% of those without compromised backups.</p>\n<h3>Offline Backups: Security vs. Cost</h3>\n<p>There are likely multiple reasons behind the discrepancy in restoration times between organizations with compromised and uncompromised backups, the report noted, not the least being the additional work typically needed to restore from decrypted data rather than well-prepared backups. It may also be that weaker backup protection is indicative of less robust defenses and greater resulting rebuilding work needed, it added.</p>\n<p>“Backups typically don’t have the same level of security controls as production systems,” said Narayana Pappu, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.zendata.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zendata</a>, a San Franciso-based data collection, management, and sharing company.</p>\n<p>“Implementing similar logging, security and access controls, and testing on backup systems would help a lot,” he told TechNewsWorld. “On top of that, having multiple copies of backups in multiple places — both in the cloud and offline — with a disaster recovery plan would reduce downtimes.”</p>\n<p>While offline backups are a good way to foil threats to backups, they can be expensive, pointed out Fechner. “If you have backups that are offline and not accessible to an attacker, then you’ve got something to backup from,” he said. “But since many organizations can’t afford that, especially when so many victims are in the small to medium business category, attacking backups is still fruitful for attackers.”</p>\n<p><i></i> <em>Editor’s Note: The <a href=\"https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/539j6fwcmx6wk6whnhxc47/sophos-the-impact-of-compromised-backups-on-ransomware-outcomes-wp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sophos report</a> is available in PDF format.

      "content": "<p>In what could be a peek at the future of AI integration in enterprises, <a href=\"https://www.microstrategy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroStrategy</a> on Tuesday announced a new addition to its platform that simplifies access to business analytical data within organizations.</p>\n<p>MicroStrategy Auto is a customizable AI bot that the company said offers a faster, simpler way to deliver business intelligence to anyone in an organization. Auto is the latest enhancement to MicroStrategy AI, released in October 2023, a solution for rapidly building AI applications on trusted data.</p>\n<p>Auto can be deployed as a standalone app or embedded into third-party applications, the company noted, and offers complete customization. Its appearance, language style, and level of detail can all be tailored to a user’s specifications.</p>\n<p>Because generative AI powers Auto, users can interact with the bot using natural language.</p>\n<p>“We use GPT4 for the backend — for figuring out what the user is asking for and how to answer the question,” explained MicroStrategy Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer Saurabh Abhyankar.</p>\n<p>“The difference between MicroStrategy and a general purpose large language model is that in addition to the cognitive skill the LLM has, we add an analytic data structure,” he told TechNewsWorld. “So if you ask how many hats do I have at store X, the LLM figures out what the user is asking, and the MicroStrategy layer executes the query, brings the data back, and applies security and rules for calculating inventory.”</p>\n<p>“You need both things in an enterprise analytics scenario because a chatbot like ChatGPT doesn’t have the context, business knowledge, security, and governance required to answer a question like that,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Unlocking User Value</h3>\n<p>Empowered by AI, Auto can remove barriers to fast, effective decision-making by making applications smarter and putting enterprise analytics in the hands of users no matter what skill level or application they’re using, the company maintained.</p>\n<p>There’s no need to use a complex dashboard to get insights, and users can ask for information in ordinary language, making it effortless to incorporate business intelligence into business decision-making, it added.</p>\n<p>“We think using MicroStrategy AI will unlock huge value by providing a variety of users with deeper insights that previously required more clicks and more granularity to understand. It’s powerful for user self-service,” Nena Pidskalny, director of supply chain strategy and planning for Federated Co-operatives Limited, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Giving more employees access to business intelligence data can benefit a company by fostering informed decision-making across departments, enabling agility in responding to market changes, and promoting a culture of data-driven decision-making,” added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smarttechresearch.net/\">SmartTech Research</a> in San Jose, Calif.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>“However, easier access to business intelligence data may lead to potential harms such as data breaches, misuse of sensitive information, and compromising competitive advantage if not properly managed and secured,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>Customized generative AI bots have some advantages over general-purpose bots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, noted Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.enderlegroup.com/\">Enderle Group</a>, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore. “Generally, they are more focused and able to do one or a few things well and potentially better,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They’re also able to run locally because they use smaller libraries.”</p>\n<p>Enderle added that customized enterprise bots can also be safer than general-purpose bots. “They generally are derivatives of large LLMs,” he explained, “but because they are reduced and more focused, in theory, they are less likely to do things you don’t want done.”</p>\n<h3>Tackling Concerns About AI</h3>\n<p>Custom generative AI bots can also address businesses’ concerns about data sharing with large chatbots. “There’s always anxiety if you’re offering up your or your customers’ proprietary information to a tool that’s going to iterate on that data and may re-present it in some way down the road,” said Will Duffield, a policy analyst at the <a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org\">Cato Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank.</p>\n<p>“Consumer-centric bots are allowing the firms behind them to use your conversations to make the bots better,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That wouldn’t be the case with a lot of these business tools because how the information can be used will be contractually specified.”</p>\n<p>“Enterprises don’t want to send all their data to a general-purpose LLM,” Abhyankar added. “They don’t want to train the LLM with their data because of the risk of that data leaking.”</p>\n<p>With MicroStrategy, he explained, data is stored in the customer’s environment. Only bits of metadata get sent to our LLM and the LLM isn’t trained with that data. “We can do that because MicroStrategy runs the calculations, and because the LLM doesn’t need to do that, it doesn’t need all the data,” he explained.</p>\n<p></p><center>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></center><p></p>\n<p>For that same reason, the LLM can be prevented from hallucinating. “LLMs, by their nature, are probabilistic,” Abhyankar said. “You can ask it questions, but you can get different answers for the same question. That’s not ideal for a business scenario.”</p>\n<p>By running calculations in the MicroStrategy layer and doing them based on the business logic that the customer has encoded in our platform we can avoid probabilistic problems, he maintained.</p>\n<p>“So challenges of data sharing and hallucinations are largely removed because of the way we use the LLM only for cognitive skills, and we use the customer’s data in the MicroStrategy layer in a trusted fashion,” he added.</p>\n<h3>Pumping Up Productivity</h3>\n<p>Making business intelligence more accessible to enterprise personnel can have productivity benefits. “It should allow decision makers to make better and more timely decisions, resulting in greater operational success,” Enderle said.</p>\n<p>Data analysts, in particular, should see productivity gains from the self-service aspect of MicroStrategy Auto. “It makes data analysts more productive because they can do more in the same amount of time,” Abhyankar said.” It’s a productivity boost for them.”</p>\n<p>“When the end-user can serve themselves, it affords the analyst key benefits,” he continued, “They get freed up to focus on higher value things because they are dealing from fewer questions and requests from end-users.”</p>\n<p>Sharad Varshney, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.ovaledge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OvalEdge</a>, a data governance consultancy and end-to-end data catalog solutions provider in Alpharetta, Ga., noted that generative AI technologies are profoundly impacting data analytics across the board. “They remove the complexity of data discovery, enabling teams like marketing or HR that aren’t traditionally analytics-focused to use company data assets easily,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>“However,” he said, “the data received must be accurately governed. While a generative AI tool can quickly find and contextualize data, it doesn’t account for data quality, lineage, or access.”</p>\n<p>“Once data is discovered, policies must be in place that ensure the user requesting the data has the relevant access permissions to extract it,” he continued. “Then, it needs to undergo various quality measurements for duplication, inconsistency, and other factors before being classified and cataloged. Only then will it be suitable for analysis.”</p>\n<p>“Thankfully,” he added, “tools are available that can automate these governance processes and others that make data analysis and visualization very straightforward.”</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>As technologies like ChatGPT exemplify, generative AI (gen AI) is rapidly evolving, prompting businesses across industries to refine their application strategies. The challenge in 2024 is to leverage these new technologies to drive positive business outcomes and enhance customer satisfaction effectively.</p>\n<p>Since its introduction, one of the main revelations has been the distinct roles this new generation of AI can fulfill, transitioning from the traditional focus on analysis and classification to creative content generation. Generative AI uses complex algorithms and neural networks to mimic human creativity, producing diverse outputs such as text, images, and music.</p>\n<p>Distinct from artificial general intelligence (AGI), which seeks to replicate full human intellectual capabilities, generative AI is task-specific. It provides practical solutions within its trained areas, adeptly handling various tasks and adapting to new situations based on incoming data.</p>\n<h3>Practical Uses and Limits of Generative AI Technology</h3>\n<p>In practice, generative AI is a potent productivity tool, enabling rapid content generation across mediums such as text, images, sounds, animations, and 3D models. It not only learns and retains patterns and nuances in language but also remembers past interactions, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant exchanges with users.</p>\n<p>However, gen AI currently falls short in decisions involving numerous complex factors, particularly those requiring deep contextual or emotional understanding. While it excels at data-driven suggestions, integrating and managing nuanced human factors remains beyond its reach, at least for now.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>According to Will Devlin, vice president of marketing at customer engagement platform firm <a href=\"http://www.messagegears.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MessageGears</a>, business and industry adopters can leverage AI without fear of failure.</p>\n<p>“Any marketer who has ever conducted a standard A/B test can tell you that failure isn’t always something to be avoided. In our careers, we constantly learn new tools, technology, and techniques. Fear of failure is always going to be a necessary part of that learning and growing process. As with anything new, there are concerns around AI that are relevant and real,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Understanding the AI Path Forward</h3>\n<p>Michael Fisher, chief product officer at digital compliance and data management firm <a href=\"https://complykey.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Complykey</a> (formerly Waterfield Technologies), has four predictions addressing those areas.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, contact centers, primary adopters of this technology, have rapidly integrated generative AI. Fisher predicts that in 2024, the focus will shift towards a deeper understanding of generative AI’s ROI.</p>\n<p>He expects contact center leaders and other AI adopters to increasingly focus on calculating the cost of AI more meaningfully. This effort includes a better understanding of how the deployment cost can be optimized related to scale and cost per transaction.</p>\n<h3>Managing Risks in Fast-Paced AI Adoption</h3>\n<p>Gen AI will continue to be adopted the fastest this year in marketing and customer prospecting, which is cross-industry, Fisher offered as a second prediction. In the lead generation business, you must consider the value, the cost, and the risks.</p>\n<p>The inherent risks are slowing adoption in highly regulated industries like health care, government, and finance. The back end of the contact center in these industries will be aggressive about using generative AI for summarizing data and reporting.</p>\n<p>“But on the customer-facing front end, those verticals will all move slower and more deliberately. The further you get away from industries that are already highly regulated, like retail, the faster generative AI adoption we’ll see,” he observed.</p>\n<h3>Advancements in Cloud and Video AI Solutions</h3>\n<p>Many companies have continued offering on-premises and cloud-based contact center solutions catering to customer preferences. However, keeping both solutions live creates a technology cost drain for vendors. So, leverage one over the other.</p>\n<p>Fisher’s third prediction was that “in 2024, more companies will sunset their on-premises solutions or raise the price significantly to make an on-premises solution commercially unviable for customers — essentially forcing cloud adoption and innovation on customers.”</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>The insurance industry uniquely uses video-based communications for things like collaborative document signing or showing accident damage to a vehicle. Most industries have been slow to adopt video as a customer service channel.</p>\n<p>“This will change in 2024. We expect video to be more broadly deployed as a customer service channel across industries, especially for companies that sell a physical product that benefits from a show-and-tell,” Fisher noted as his fourth leveraging prediction.</p>\n<p>Specific use cases will help drive demand for this feature. Changing consumer preferences, led by Gen Z’s comfort and familiarity with video-based content, may also help, he shared.</p>\n<h3>Precision in Handling Massive AI Data Sets</h3>\n<p>MessageGear’s Devlin thinks it is vital that as brands start to harness AI — particularly generative AI — they put guardrails in place and develop standard operating procedures and guidelines for their teams to follow.</p>\n<p>That will be a learning process. Companies must realize that Gen AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>\n<p>“I expect that AI technology will only get better as we get more hands-on with it,” he cautioned, adding, “Because AI is such a new technology, brands are still navigating how to manage it and ensure they use it responsibly and to its fullest potential.”</p>\n<p>A recently conducted survey by MessageGears of marketers at enterprise brands showed that the most significant challenges brands face when implementing AI solutions are limited expertise, staff training, and integration complexity.</p>\n<p>“AI modeling is only as good as the data you put into it. Conversely, AI can be a powerful tool, helping brands improve conversions and ROI, save time, reduce time-to-value, and improve testing and learning,” Devlin told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<h3>Integrating Human Insight with AI Technology</h3>\n<p>Shahid Ahmed, group EVP for new ventures and innovation at digital consulting firm <a href=\"https://services.global.ntt/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NTT Data</a>, revealed that his company’s 2023 Global Customer Experience Report found that the majority of CX interactions still require a form of human intervention.</p>\n<p>According to this report, executives agree this will remain a critical part of customer journeys. Despite 80% of organizations planning to incorporate AI into CX delivery within the next 12 months, the human element will be central to its success.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>“As enterprises turn their attention to how automation can complement and enhance human capabilities, they will place greater emphasis on closing the mounting skills shortages that will challenge AI aspirations,” Ahmed told TechNewsWorld.</p>\n<p>He cautioned that the fundamentals of AI and big data analytics will become baseline skills for most jobs across industries, and new hires will not be the only pathway.</p>\n<p>“Research by NTT Data uncovered that business leaders are more likely to have seen profitability of more than 25% over the last three years because of investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives. This trend will continue in 2024, with more curated teaching experiences to help close skills gaps and meet the needs of organizations,” he advised.</p>\n<h3>The Risks of DIY AI Implementation</h3>\n<p>AI’s best leveraging approach might well be in a managed cloud combination. AI is everywhere today. Adopters should ponder what numbers chart this explosive growth.</p>\n<p>A report by cloud security provider <a href=\"https://www.wiz.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wiz</a> shows a key connection between using AI services via a managed cloud platform. Its analysis of aggregate data related to a large sample of organizations provides a comprehensive overview of how generative AI and machine learning are being used in the cloud and its implications for organizations.</p>\n<p>According to that research, AI is rapidly gaining ground in cloud environments. Over 70% of organizations now use managed AI services. At that percentage, the adoption of AI technology rivals the popularity of managed Kubernetes services, which Wiz sees in over 80% of organizations.</p>\n<p>Another noteworthy view is many organizations experiment with AI but do not go beyond that step.</p>\n<p>Only 10% are power users who deployed 50 or more instances in their environments. While the adoption of AI in the cloud is soaring, many organizations (32%) still appear to be in the experimentation phase with these tools, deploying fewer than 10 instances of AI services in their cloud environments., according to the report.</p>\n<h3>Enhancing Gen AI With Predictive Analytics</h3>\n<p>For most folks, 2023 was the year that AI came into focus, with adopters asking how to utilize it best, observed MessageGear’s Devlin. Now, if they have not already started using AI regularly, most brands are, at the very least, AI-curious.</p>\n<p>“They want to test and see how it can help them and are ready to explore. As brands become more comfortable with the idea of AI, I think we’ll see certain roles grow in complexity while others are made more efficient using AI tools,” he noted.</p>\n<p>Generative AI becomes especially powerful when paired with insights from predictive AI. Not only do you know when and where a customer wants to hear from you, but you also know the likelihood that they will make a purchase and what language and imagery will likely sway them to act.</p>\n<p>“It’s a combination that brands are only beginning to take advantage of, and it has almost infinite potential,” he concluded.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Selecting the best computer for your business can be a straightforward process if you plan ahead. Check out these factors to make the most of your purchase. Pro Tip: Bargain prices should not be the deciding factor.</p>\n<p>If you run a small business or work from home, you might not need a dedicated business computer with high-end features you never use. However, if you need to purchase a new computer system for an office environment, determining what best fits that space’s needs will help you select the ideal office computing solution.</p>\n<p>A consumer-grade machine can be a good choice if the business usage differs little from what consumers normally do with a computer. However, business-grade gear may be your only reasonable option if your daily business tasks require heavy-duty operations. If so, here is how to make the best choice.</p>\n<p>That assessment should consider whether the needed software is available via a cloud connection. If it is, almost any machine you buy can access it via a web browser. But if you must run the software locally, your new computer will do much of the heavy lifting.</p>\n<h3>Initial Check: Power User Requirements</h3>\n<p>Power users run specialized, high-powered applications that need advanced processing ability. Do not skimp on the configuration if you are in the power user category. Shift your focus to high-quality business computers.</p>\n<p>Store-grade consumer equipment is not always designed to withstand that level of always-on service. Internal components such as hard drive storage and power units are often the first to fail under these conditions. Moisture and dust-resistant cases can be vital to sustaining mission-critical PCs.</p>\n<p>Larger companies have access to IT-based buying options from major manufacturers. Smaller firms and small business owners are often better served by ordering from major manufacturers or supply houses because they provide set-up and tech support services through business accounts.</p>\n<p>Other than extended warranty offers and Geek Squad-style repair services, big box stores and digital marketplaces offer little else for business purchases.</p>\n<h3>Desktop vs. Laptop for Business Needs</h3>\n<p>Whether you opt for a desktop or laptop depends entirely on your working environment and mobility needs. Today’s laptops offer convenience and performance as desktop replacements, and they have mostly buried the portability versus power debates.</p>\n<p>Laptop computers used to be considered inferior for business use because they lacked the hardware quality found only in bigger and heavier desktop designs. That is no longer the case. Advanced technology has eliminated much of the gap that once distinguished the power and capability of desktops from laptop computers.</p>\n<p>In general, buying desktop PCs for your business may only make sense for office-bound workers. Laptops can provide flexibility in workspace design and flexible workplace locations.</p>\n<p>Screen size is no longer a purchase detriment. When plugged into a large desktop monitor, a smaller-screen laptop equals or exceeds the productivity potential of big desktop boxes.</p>\n<h3>Speed and Efficiency Factors for Business PCs</h3>\n<p>When assessing hardware options for office use, prioritize two crucial specifications: on-board storage and processing power. Businesses utilizing cloud storage and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications might find it viable to adjust these specifications to align with budgetary constraints.</p>\n<p>The central processing unit (CPU) is critical in defining a computer’s operational speed and multitasking capabilities. The efficiency of a CPU is mainly determined by two factors: its clock speed, measured in GHz, and the number of cores it possesses. A higher clock speed and more cores equate to improved performance and speed.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Furthermore, a CPU’s number of cores and threads enhances its multitasking ability, enabling it to handle multiple tasks concurrently. This capability is vital for applications that demand high levels of multitasking.</p>\n<p>Less important in today’s market is having Intel chips inside. Computers with AMD processors generally cost several hundred dollars less without compromising quality. The specific processor used by either manufacturer is more important to consider. Check out product tests to see which ones outperform others and choose accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Choosing the Right Processor</h3>\n<p>A dual-core processor usually suffices for basic office tasks, striking a balance between cost and performance efficiency. However, quad-core and octa-core processors are preferable for demanding tasks involving data processing, graphic design, or extensive <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/sourcetable-ai-spreadsheet-aims-to-democratize-data-analytics-179677.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spreadsheet</a> calculations. These higher-spec processors significantly enhance performance, making them preferable for more intensive applications.</p>\n<p>The computer’s performance is also related to its amount of random-access memory (RAM). The more RAM your computer has, the more things it can keep in memory at once, making it run faster. Not all RAM is created equal. DDR4 RAM is newer and faster than DDR3 RAM. It is also more expensive, but it is worth the cost.</p>\n<p>Check if the computer you want to buy lets you upgrade RAM. On many computer models, you can order memory upgrades at purchase or swap in additional RAM chips to increase it later. Having more RAM improves the overall performance of slower processors. You can trade off a slower CPU in favor of more RAM to adjust the purchase cost.</p>\n<h3>Running Windows 11? Don’t Be RAM Shy</h3>\n<p>The predominant computer systems in business offices run Microsoft Windows 10 or 11. Both require more memory than earlier Windows versions, which ran reasonably well on only 4GB.</p>\n<p>Ensure you choose computers with sufficient RAM. Many consumers overlook the importance of additional RAM when purchasing a new computer, a critical oversight for business use that can be a deal-breaker.</p>\n<p>A minimum of 8GB of RAM is essential for optimal performance in business applications; however, capacities of 12GB, 16GB, or even 32GB are significantly more effective and desirable for handling more demanding tasks. Therefore, it’s advisable not to compromise on RAM capacity.</p>\n<h3>Apple vs. Windows: Business Buying Considerations</h3>\n<p>If you prefer Apple computers, the CPU and RAM configurations are standardized, making the buying options more straightforward, yet limited, for desktop and laptop models.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that upgrading Apple’s CPU and RAM configurations after purchase can be challenging, if not impossible. Therefore, choosing the suitable configuration at the time of sale is crucial, as Apple advises buyers to carefully assess their needs before deciding.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>In contrast, Windows desktop and laptop PCs offer more flexibility for upgrades, are generally less costly, and provide a broader range of options. If you are deciding between Windows and macOS options, Windows PCs are the less expensive option.</p>\n<h3>Storage Size for Better Business Efficiency</h3>\n<p>Depending on your company’s record-keeping practices and lack of cloud services, data and application storage might be a critical factor. Be picky about the type of storage hardware the computer you buy has. How fast it transfers data from onboard storage components affects its overall performance.</p>\n<p>Modern computers offer two primary storage options: hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). While an older technology, HDDs provide a cost-effective solution for acquiring larger storage capacities. Conversely, SSDs, known for their compactness and speed, provide a durable and faster storage solution, albeit at a higher cost, which their longevity and performance benefits can justify.</p>\n<p>Hard drives can be as small as 128GB and as large as 2TB. Business use quickly consumes between 500GB and 1TB. Do not consider any storage drive under 250GB in a desktop or laptop computer for business.</p>\n<h3>Monitor the Viewing Screen for Productivity Purposes</h3>\n<p>When selecting monitors for desktop computers or screens for laptops, it’s essential to consider size, resolution, and brightness to foster a productive and eye-friendly work environment. Brightness, measured in nits, is particularly crucial in well-lit office settings, where a minimum brightness of 300 nits can compensate for ambient light.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Larger monitors reduce the need to scroll often. The minimum size to consider for a desktop system is 21 inches, according to productivity pros. But go bigger if you can. Get a high-definition (HD) monitor as a minimum choice point. Consider 4K, 5K, and 8K configurations for more intense office needs.</p>\n<p>Consider adopting a dual-monitor setup to enhance workspace efficiency. Connecting a large desktop monitor to a laptop can be a productivity asset by providing a more extensive and flexible viewing area.</p>\n<h3>Final Points to Consider When Buying a Business PC</h3>\n<p>Especially in business circles, buying a new computer does not involve considering operating system changes. If a company is already invested in using Microsoft Windows or Apple gear, that is what the new computer runs.</p>\n<p>However, SMBs and small office environments often miss the opportunity to change computing directions when buying computers. Even leaders at larger organizations should consider the less-costly options of installing the free, open-source Linux operating system on existing computers since many larger companies are already vested in using Linux for cloud services and on-site server operations.</p>\n<p>More of that Linux adoption needs to find its way into corporate offices to handle daily office workloads. Running the Linux operating system on a new or old computer provides the ultimate computing flexibility.</p>\n<p>The same argument exists for using Chromebooks with their web-browser interface. That shift involves much less costly hardware and gives organizations the option to run both Apple and Windows software, as well as mobile Android apps, which are already a mainstream reality for consumers.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/insider-tips-for-buying-a-new-personal-computer-178806.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">computer buying guide for consumers</a> for more insights on how to buy a new computer and the range of operating system options.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><i></i> Suggest a Topic</h3>\n<p>Is there a tech tutorial you’d like to see featured?</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto: jack.germain@newsroom.ectnews.com\">Email your ideas to me,</a> and I’ll consider them for a future column.</p>\n<p>And use the Reader Comments feature below to provide your input!</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>During the past 40 years, hackers have graduated from worm attacks in the 1980s to fully funded organizations tapping into some of the most lucrative industries in the world. Today, cybercrime is a significant threat to any company with a device attached to the internet and continues to cause substantial economic impact worldwide.</p>\n<p>The modern-day cyberattack can trace its roots back to the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/morris-worm-30-years-since-first-major-attack-on-internet-110218#:~:text=At%20around%208%3A30%20p.m.,grinding%20computers%20to%20a%20halt.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1988 Morris worm attack</a>. Before the World Wide Web had made an impact, a small program launched from a computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) propagated remarkably. It infected an estimated 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 computers connected to the internet at the time. Although it was difficult to calculate the exact damage caused by the Morris worm, estimates put it anywhere between US$100,000 and the millions.</p>\n<p>Over the decades, cybercrime has become more sophisticated, with threats reflecting geopolitical tensions and hackers gaining notoriety. In 1999, a teenager hacked into the DoD and NASA and installed backdoor access to servers to download $1.7 million in software. Fast-forward to 2021, and the <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/dissecting-the-colonial-pipeline-incident-87138.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colonial Pipeline</a> in the U.S. was subject to a ransomware attack that forced the company to shut the pipeline down and pay $4.4 million via Bitcoin. In 2023, the CIOp gang exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer software that affected 2,000 organizations and an estimated 62 million people.</p>\n<h3>Economic Scale of Cybercrime</h3>\n<p>The United States, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $25.44 trillion at the end of 2022, is by far the world’s largest economy. China followed in second place, with a GDP of $17.96 trillion. However, cybercrime is growing at a remarkable rate. In 2021, it caused global damages that cost $6 trillion — approximately $2 trillion more than the GDP of Japan — the country with the world’s third-largest economy.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.evolvesecurity.com/blog-posts/actual-cost-of-cybercrime#:~:text=The%20Global%20Cost%20of%20Cybercrime&amp;text=The%20cybercrime%20industry%20is%20growing,over%20the%20next%20five%20years. \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Evolve Security</a>, cybercrime will grow by 15% annually over the next five years. Estimates from <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/cybersecurity/worldwide#cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista’s cybersecurity outlook</a> see the annual global cost of cybercrime rising to nearly $24 trillion by 2027, compared to $8.4 trillion in 2022.</p>\n<p>In Germany, a study by <a href=\"https://www.bitkom.org/EN \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitkom</a> highlighted that cybercrimes have caused total damages amounting to 206 billion euros, representing 5% of the nation’s GDP. Furthermore, 62% of companies view cybersecurity threats as significantly large, with phishing, password attacks, malware infections, ransomware, and SQL injection being the most commonly recorded forms of attack.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IT Governance</a>, the Top 10 Cybersecurity Breaches in 2023 by organization, location, and records breached were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DarkBeam, U.K., 3,800,000,000 records breached</li>\n<li>Real Estate Wealth Network, U.S.,1,523,776,691 records breached</li>\n<li>Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), India, 815,000,000 records breached</li>\n<li>Kid Security, Kazakhstan, 300,000,000 records breached</li>\n<li>Twitter (X), U.S., 220,000,000 records breached</li>\n<li>TuneFab, Hong Kong, 151,000,000 records breached</li>\n<li>Dori Media Group, Israel, 100 TB of data breached</li>\n<li>Tigo, Hong Kong, 100,000,000 records breached</li>\n<li>SAP SE Bulgaria, Bulgaria, 95,592,696 records breached</li>\n<li>Luxottica Group, Italy, 70,000,000 records breached</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>New Tools Bring Elevated Cyberthreats</h3>\n<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning become central to the cybersecurity dialogue, the landscape of digital threats is intensifying. The adoption of technologies like IoT and Industry 4.0 unveils new vulnerabilities, while an increasing number of threat actors leverage AI to enhance their hacking capabilities. Furthermore, attackers are broadening their targets to include cloud environments and the sensitive data housed in SaaS companies’ application services.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>Cybercriminals are nebulous; they collaborate across borders and have adopted hierarchies and specialized roles that make these bad actors more sophisticated, which is a significant challenge for law enforcement to track and prosecute them.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Global Risks Report 2020</a> by the World Economic Forum, “Organized cybercrime entities are joining forces, and their likelihood of detection and prosecution is estimated to be as low as 0.05% in the United States.”</p>\n<p>These bad actors focus on specific industries and accurately tailor their exploits. In addition, the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service enables hackers with limited experience to execute successful attacks, and the dark web remains an encrypted communication channel to plan activities with anonymity.</p>\n<h3>Remember Analog Crimes? They Are Still a Factor</h3>\n<p>Cybersecurity breaches still occur from non-digital or physical system components and are often overlooked. These non-digital areas include unauthorized access to secure data centers or other physical locations where sensitive information is stored.</p>\n<p>Unsecured physical access allows employees or contractors to leverage sensitive information for social engineering breaches. Organizations must also be concerned about improperly disposing of sensitive documents and hardware tampering that modifies devices with malicious code.</p>\n<p>In addition to the physical analog tightening, the software supply chain needs particular attention. It is still a weak link that can have a devastating impact. Companies must not only maintain their security protocols but also scrutinize the security practices of their third-party suppliers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, threat actors continue to use deepfake social engineering attacks to foster ransomware, gain permissions, and access sensitive data with the relative success and ease of phishing campaigns.</p>\n<h3>Fortifying Cybercrime Defenses</h3>\n<p>Cybercrime’s GDP of $6 trillion has made it the world’s third-largest economic superpower. No one is immune to an attack from small mom-and-pop Main Street shops to Wall Street financial juggernauts. From Bulgaria to the U.S., we are all targets. As these shadow organizations become more organized and sophisticated, cybersecurity will have to morph into a must-have business utility such as energy or cloud services.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>The advent of AI and machine learning holds immense possibilities for advancing corporate productivity. By contrast, the same tools applied to nefarious activities will unleash global IP devastation and chaos. Ignorance will be the Trojan Horse that opens networks to bad actors and continues a revenue stream for cybercrimes.</p>\n<p>To remedy the activities of this well-funded, borderless entity, we need persistent, pervasive measures to tighten the physical and digital aspects of devices, platforms, and systems. Without the full knowledge of all attack vectors — including partner systems in the supply chain — a well-informed and trained employee base, and the application of sophisticated cybersecurity tools, organizations will continue to be the victims and unwillingly fund their perpetrators.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>I watched IBM Think last week. As I listened to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna talk about how IBM is willing to configure hardware, software, and services for every customer, it struck me that the one thing we are not doing with AI is thinking it through. We are throwing AI at everything and not prioritizing where we need it to focus.</p>\n<p>We had the same issue with nuclear energy early on. We could focus it on safe, low-cost energy generation or on destroying the planet. We initially focused on destroying the planet, followed by unsafe energy generation (Chernobyl, Three Mile Island).</p>\n<p>A meme on social media says, “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.”</p>\n<p>Let’s explore this lack of thinking about AI use in the context of last week’s <a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/story/intel-announces-new-tech-to-battle-in-ai-market-179220.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a> at Computex of the impressive Intel Lunar Lake platform.</p>\n<p>We’ll close with my Product of the Week, “Trustworthy,” which exemplifies a better direction for AI and will help us better prepare for the future problems that all our families might face.</p>\n<h3>IBM Think</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/history/think\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Think slogan</a> goes back to Thomas Watson, Sr. In 1915, as a sales manager for NCR, he developed the saying after becoming frustrated that no one on his executive team seemed to have any ideas. He argued, “The trouble with every one of us is that we don’t think enough. We don’t get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads.”</p>\n<p>This lack of thinking is what we’re not addressing when it comes to AI.</p>\n<p>Like any powerful tool, AI is neither good nor bad. Like nuclear technology, it depends on how the technology is used. Currently, there is a lot of focus on building ever more powerful AI weapons, some of which are pretty scary. This drone-delivered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0mnymzGKs0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weaponized Chinese robotic dog</a> could be a scene from “The Terminator,” and that is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLLyyqkue4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">far from the only example</a>.</p>\n<h3>Back at the Beginning and IBM Watson</h3>\n<p>When IBM started Watson, it was accidentally focused on winning game shows to demonstrate its capabilities. However, much of the initial work was on providing better and more timely medical advice.</p>\n<p>While IBM’s inability to reliably access medical data and the potential liability of getting that wrong forced it to pivot away from this market, it did highlight that IBM was following the “Think” process because better medical care should be an exceedingly high, if not the highest, priority. It should come way before AI weapons systems.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11238:adsense-tnw-art cc: --></div>\n<p>Medical costs, particularly here in the U.S., are incredibly high, while medical quality is largely deficient, which seems like the worst of all worlds. AI could address the cost and the quality of medical services, but right now, that does not appear to be a top priority, giving way to the more troubling uses of AI.</p>\n<p>I think rather than focusing on throwing AI at everything, we should have a priority list of things we want AI to do. Toward the top would be a far better digital assistant.</p>\n<h3>Lunar Lake vs. Snapdragon X Elite</h3>\n<p>Your digital assistant will need to be with you while you work, and much of our initial AI use will be tied to making us more productive. However, we need to push up the quality requirements of this effort because, in the last head-to-head comparison, Microsoft Copilot ranked last. It is interesting to note that the current iteration of ChatGPT, which is the basis of Copilot, ranked second while <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perplexity</a> ranked first. We don’t only need AI with us; we need the information it provides to be accurate and useful, and right now, Copilot is falling short.</p>\n<p>Copilot+, which includes Recall and Cocreator, was designed to work on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite processor, and initially, both AMD and Intel were bypassed. However, both companies have put in a ton of work to close this gap, and it looks like the next big AI chip drop will come from Intel and its high-end client processors code-named Lunar Lake.</p>\n<p>Lunar Lake represents a massive effort from Intel and brings to market a level of capability we weren’t expecting until 2026. Still, it will also be more expensive, allowing Qualcomm to likely own mainstream notebooks until AMD’s more affordable alternative comes to market.</p>\n<div>\n                    <!--ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: s_c:11252,11244,11238,10726 px:0--><div>   </div> <!--/ps: 55 crid: 11252:a-nice-q225-970x250-fwave cc: --></div>\n<p>However, and this again goes to priorities, you’d think workstations and desktop PCs would have been prioritized because that is where professional creators still live, and even workstation laptops aren’t included in the initial Copilot+ efforts. The closest thing to a Copilot+ workstation is the Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/05/qualcomm-accelerates-development-for-copilot--pcs-with-snapdrago\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows</a> which people who want this AI functionality in a desktop are buying up.</p>\n<p>Given that desktops and workstations don’t require the power of laptops and are used by developers, who are more Microsoft’s primary customers than end users, you’d think desktop and laptop workstations would be a priority. Nvidia prevailed on Microsoft to embrace their platform, and AMD is right there with them, but with a gaming focus.</p>\n<p>Focusing on gaming is important because smart non-player characters (NPCs) could make an enormous difference in games, both as opponents and partners. Imagine, for instance, having a bonded pet like a dragon that could fight and protect you intelligently, let alone an in-game helper who could guide you through some of the more challenging puzzles (I hate puzzles in games).</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up: AI Priorities</h3>\n<p><a name=\"product-of-the-week\"></a></p>\n<p>Back to priorities: I think AI should first help us make better decisions and then focus on those things that take the pleasure out of life, like cleaning, doing the laundry, driving in traffic, checking our work (but not doing it for us), and helping us form better relationships or make relationships work.</p>\n<p>In the end, AI could make the world a better place or one that was much, much worse. Personally, I’d prefer the former over the latter. I don’t need more difficulty in my life, but I could certainly use more help.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/article_images/product-of-the-week_585x75.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Product of the Week\" width=\"585\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Trustworthy: The Family Operating System</h3>\n<p>On the topic of where I think AI should be focused, it is helping us manage our personal and family life.</p>\n<p>From maintaining documentation so that, should something happen to us, those left behind can more quickly and easily manage our estates and bills, to keeping track of critical records like mortgages, birth certificates, credit cards, retirement accounts, insurance, and passwords, the <a href=\"https://www.trustworthy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trustworthy Family Operating System</a> helps with the annoying tasks that can take the fun out of your personal life.</p>\n<p>Trustworthy uses AI, but it is memoryless, as it doesn’t learn from customer data. It caught my attention because I’ve been dealing with a lot of this stuff lately and really could use some help like what Trustworthy provides. This video provides an overview.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Trustworthy - The Family Operating System®\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fe3cGIKOj64\" width=\"100%\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Given my focus on AI for good, Trustworthy seemed like an ideal example of where we should focus AI. In this case, it better prepares us for disruptive events, recovering from natural disasters, death, getting ready for retirement or relocation, and just bringing a bit of control and peace of mind to our overly complex daily lives.</p>\n<p>Trustworthy starts with a modest service for protecting financial information for $120 a year. It jumps up to $240 a year for families that also have business interests, then $590 with three hours of service to help you throughout the year and to initially get set up, and finally, $990 for those needing a lot of help, such as an aging relative who needs six hours of help to get decades of mess into order.</p>\n<p>Data is encrypted. It uses multi-factor authentication (biometrics) to help ensure this critical information stays safe and uses tokens to obfuscate sensitive information further. It also regularly redacts sensitive information like driver’s license numbers to protect it from prying eyes.</p>\n<p>I think Trustworthy is closer to where we need AI-focused: making our lives easier, eliminating stress, and keeping us safer rather than taking our jobs, eliminating our incomes, or powering deadly weapons. As a result, Trustworthy: The Family Operating System is my Product of the Week.</p>\n",
